<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document specifies a mechanism for managing stateful DNS connections.  DNS most commonly operates over a UDP transport, but it can also operate over streaming transports; the original DNS RFC specifies DNS-over-TCP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a>, and a profile for DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a> has been specified.  These transports can offer persistent long-lived sessions and therefore, when using them for transporting DNS messages, it is of benefit to have a mechanism that can establish parameters associated with those sessions, such as timeouts.  In such situations, it is also advantageous to support server-initiated messages (such as DNS Push Notifications <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The existing Extension Mechanism for DNS (EDNS(0)) <a href="#RFC6891" class="xref">[RFC6891]</a> is explicitly defined to only have "per-message" semantics. While EDNS(0) has been used to signal at least one session-related parameter (edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option <a href="#RFC7828" class="xref">[RFC7828]</a>), the result is less than optimal due to the restrictions imposed by the EDNS(0) semantics and the lack of server-initiated signaling.  For example, a server cannot arbitrarily instruct a client to close a connection because the server can only send EDNS(0) options in responses to queries that contained EDNS(0) options.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document defines a new DNS OPCODE for DNS Stateful Operations (DSO) with a value of 6.  DSO messages are used to communicate operations within persistent stateful sessions, expressed using Type Length Value (TLV) syntax.  This document defines an initial set of three TLVs used to manage session timeouts, termination, and encryption padding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">All three TLVs defined here are mandatory for all implementations of DSO.  Further TLVs may be defined in additional specifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">DSO messages may or may not be acknowledged.  Whether a DSO message is to be acknowledged (a DSO request message) or is not to be acknowledged (a DSO unidirectional message) is specified in the definition of that particular DSO message type.  The MESSAGE ID is nonzero for DSO request messages, and zero for DSO unidirectional messages.  Messages are pipelined and responses may appear out of order when multiple requests are being processed concurrently.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">The format for DSO messages (<a href="#format" class="xref">Section 5.4</a>) differs somewhat from the traditional DNS message format used for standard queries and responses.  The standard twelve-byte header is used, but the four count fields (QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) are set to zero, and accordingly their corresponding sections are not present.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The actual data pertaining to DNS Stateful Operations (expressed in TLV syntax) is appended to the end of the DNS message header.  Just as in traditional DNS-over-TCP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a> <a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a>, the stream protocol carrying DSO messages (which are just another kind of DNS message) frames them by putting a 16-bit message length at the start. The length of the DSO message is therefore determined from that length rather than from any of the DNS header counts.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">When displayed using packet analyzer tools that have not been updated to recognize the DSO format, this will result in the DSO data being displayed as unknown extra data after the end of the DNS message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">This new format has distinct advantages over an RR-based format because it is more explicit and more compact. Each TLV definition is specific to its use case and, as a result, contains no redundant or overloaded fields.  Importantly, it completely avoids conflating DNS Stateful Operations in any way with normal DNS operations or with existing EDNS(0)-based functionality.  A goal of this approach is to avoid the operational issues that have befallen EDNS(0), particularly relating to middlebox behavior (see sections discussing EDNS(0), and problems caused by firewalls and load balancers, in the recent work describing causes of DNS failures <a href="#Fail" class="xref">[Fail]</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.10">With EDNS(0), multiple options may be packed into a single OPT pseudo-RR, and there is no generalized mechanism for a client to be able to tell whether a server has processed or otherwise acted upon each individual option within the combined OPT pseudo-RR.  The specifications for each individual option need to define how each different option is to be acknowledged, if necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.11">In contrast to EDNS(0), with DSO there is no compelling motivation to pack multiple operations into a single message for efficiency reasons, because DSO always operates using a connection-oriented transport protocol.  Each DSO operation is communicated in its own separate DNS message, and the transport protocol can take care of packing several DNS messages into a single IP packet if appropriate.  For example, TCP can pack multiple small DNS messages into a single TCP segment.  This simplification allows for clearer semantics.  Each DSO request message communicates just one primary operation, and the RCODE in the corresponding response message indicates the success or failure of that operation.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.1">4.1.1.</a> <a href="#sessionmanagement" id="sessionmanagement">Session Management</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">In one use case, establishing session parameters such as server-defined timeouts is of great use in the general management of persistent connections. For example, using DSO Sessions for stub-to-recursive DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a> is more flexible for both the client and the server than attempting to manage sessions using just the edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option <a href="#RFC7828" class="xref">[RFC7828]</a>.  The simple set of TLVs defined in this document is sufficient to greatly enhance connection management for this use case.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.2">4.1.2.</a> <a href="#subscriptions" id="subscriptions">Long-Lived Subscriptions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">In another use case, DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <a href="#RFC6763" class="xref">[RFC6763]</a> has evolved into a naturally session-based mechanism where, for example, long-lived subscriptions lend themselves to 'push' mechanisms as opposed to polling. Long-lived stateful connections and server-initiated messages align with this use case <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.2">A general use case is that DNS traffic is often bursty, but session establishment can be expensive.  One challenge with long-lived connections is sustaining sufficient traffic to maintain NAT and firewall state.  To mitigate this issue, this document introduces a new concept for the DNS -- DSO "keepalive traffic".  This traffic carries no DNS data and is not considered 'activity' in the classic DNS sense, but it serves to maintain state in middleboxes and to assure the client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</p>
<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#transports" id="transports">Applicable Transports</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">DNS Stateful Operations are applicable in cases where it is useful to maintain an open session between a DNS client and server, where the transport allows such a session to be maintained, and where the transport guarantees in-order delivery of messages on which DSO depends.  Two specific transports that meet the requirements to support DNS Stateful Operations are DNS-over-TCP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a> <a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a> and DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Note that in the case of DNS-over-TLS, there is no mechanism for upgrading from DNS-over-TCP to DNS-over-TLS mid-connection (see Section 7 of the DNS-over-TLS specification <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a>).  A connection is either DNS-over-TCP from the start, or DNS-over-TLS from the start.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">DNS Stateful Operations are not applicable for transports that cannot support clean session semantics or that do not guarantee in-order delivery.   While in principle such a transport could be constructed over UDP, the current specification of DNS-over-UDP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a> does not provide in-order delivery or session semantics and hence cannot be used.  Similarly, DNS-over-HTTP <a href="#RFC8484" class="xref">[RFC8484]</a> cannot be used because HTTP has its own mechanism for managing sessions, which is incompatible with the mechanism specified here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">Only DNS-over-TCP and DNS-over-TLS are currently defined for use with DNS Stateful Operations.  Other transports may be added in the future if they meet the requirements set out in the first paragraph of this section.</p>

<dt>Connected but Sessionless:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A connection exists, but a DSO Session has not been established.   DNS messages can be sent from the client to server, and DNS responses can be sent from the server to the client.

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">In order for a session to be established between a client and a server, the client must first establish a connection to the server using an applicable transport (see <a href="#transports" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">In some environments, it may be known in advance by external means that both client and server support DSO, and in these cases either client or server may initiate DSO messages at any time.  In this case, the session is established as soon as the connection is established; this is referred to as implicit DSO Session establishment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">However, in the typical case a server will not know in advance whether a client supports DSO, so in general, unless it is known in advance by other means that a client does support DSO, a server MUST NOT initiate DSO request messages or DSO unidirectional messages until a DSO Session has been mutually established by at least one successful DSO request/response exchange initiated by the client, as described below.   This is referred to as explicit DSO Session establishment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">Until a DSO Session has been implicitly or explicitly established, a client MUST NOT initiate DSO unidirectional messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">A DSO Session is established over a connection by the client sending a DSO request message, such as a DSO Keepalive request message (<a href="#keepalive" class="xref">Section 7.1</a>), and receiving a response with a matching MESSAGE ID, and RCODE set to NOERROR (0), indicating that the DSO request was successful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.6">Some DSO messages are permitted as early data (<a href="#zrtt" class="xref">Section 11.1</a>).  Others are not.  Unidirectional messages are never permitted as early data, unless an implicit DSO Session exists.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.7">If a server receives a DSO message in early data whose Primary TLV is not permitted to appear in early data, the server MUST forcibly abort the connection.  If a client receives a DSO message in early data, and there is no implicit DSO Session, the client MUST forcibly abort the connection.   This can only be enforced on TLS connections; therefore, servers MUST NOT enable TCP Fast Open (TFO) when listening for a connection that does not require TLS.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.1.p.1">If the response RCODE is set to NOTIMP (4), or in practice any value other than NOERROR (0) or DSOTYPENI (defined below), then the client MUST assume that the server does not implement DSO at all. In this case, the client is permitted to continue sending DNS messages on that connection but MUST NOT issue further DSO messages on that connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.1.p.2">If the RCODE in the response is set to DSOTYPENI ("DSO-TYPE Not Implemented"; RCODE 11), this indicates that the server does support DSO but does not implement the DSO-TYPE of the Primary TLV in this DSO request message.  A server implementing DSO MUST NOT return DSOTYPENI for a DSO Keepalive request message because the Keepalive TLV is mandatory to implement.  But in the future, if a client attempts to establish a DSO Session using a response-requiring DSO request message using some newly-defined DSO-TYPE that the server does not understand, that would result in a DSOTYPENI response.  If the server returns DSOTYPENI, then a DSO Session is not considered established. The client is, however, permitted to continue sending DNS messages on the connection, including other DSO messages such as the DSO Keepalive, which may result in a successful NOERROR response, yielding the establishment of a DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.1.p.3">When a DSO message is received by an existing DNS server that doesn't recognize the DSO OPCODE, two other possible outcomes exist: the server might send no response to the DSO message, or the server might drop the connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.1.p.4">If the server sends no response to the DSO message, the client SHOULD wait 30 seconds, after which time the server will be assumed not to support DSO.  If the server doesn't respond within 30 seconds, the client MUST forcibly abort the connection to the server since the server's behavior does not conform to the specification, and hence its state is undefined.  The client MAY reconnect, but not use DSO, if appropriate (<a href="#forcereconnect" class="xref">Section 6.6.3.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.1.p.5">If the server drops the connection the client SHOULD mark that service instance as not supporting DSO, and not attempt a DSO connection for some period of time (at least an hour) after the failed attempt.   The client MAY reconnect but not use DSO, if appropriate (<a href="#dropreconnect" class="xref">Section 6.6.3.2</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">Because a server that supports DNS Stateful Operations MUST return an RCODE of "NOERROR" when it receives a Keepalive TLV DSO request message, the Keepalive TLV is an ideal candidate for use in establishing a DSO Session.  Any other option that can only succeed when sent to a server of the desired kind is also a good candidate for use in establishing a DSO Session.  For clients that implement only the DSO-TYPEs defined in this base specification, sending a Keepalive TLV is the only DSO request message they have available to initiate a DSO Session.  Even for clients that do implement other future DSO-TYPEs, for simplicity they MAY elect to always send an initial DSO Keepalive request message as their way of initiating a DSO Session.  A future definition of a new response-requiring DSO-TYPE gives implementers the option of using that new DSO-TYPE if they wish, but does not change the fact that sending a Keepalive TLV remains a valid way of initiating a DSO Session.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">A DSO Session is terminated when the underlying connection is closed.  DSO Sessions are "closed gracefully" as a result of the server closing a DSO Session because it is overloaded, because of the client closing the DSO Session because it is done, or because of the client closing the DSO Session because it is inactive.   DSO Sessions are "forcibly aborted" when either the client or server closes the connection because of a protocol error.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Where this specification says "close gracefully", it means sending a TLS close_notify (if TLS is in use) followed by a TCP FIN, or the equivalent for other protocols.  Where this specification requires a connection to be closed gracefully, the requirement to initiate that graceful close is placed on the client in order to place the burden of TCP's TIME-WAIT state on the client rather than the server.</li>
<li>Where this specification says "forcibly abort", it means sending a TCP RST or the equivalent for other protocols.  In the BSD Sockets API, this is achieved by setting the SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.2">The second is situations that should never happen when communicating with a compliant DSO implementation.  If they do happen, they indicate a serious flaw in the protocol implementation beyond what is reasonable to expect software to recover from.

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.1">In a DSO unidirectional message, the MESSAGE ID field MUST be set to zero.  In a DSO request message, the MESSAGE ID field MUST be set to a unique nonzero value that the initiator is not currently using for any other active operation on this connection.  For the purposes here, a MESSAGE ID is in use in this DSO Session if the initiator has used it in a DSO request message for which it is still awaiting a response, or if the client has used it to set up a long-lived operation that has not yet been canceled.  For example, a long-lived operation could be a Push Notification subscription <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a> or a Discovery Relay interface subscription <a href="#Relay" class="xref">[Relay]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.2">Whether a message is a DSO request message or a DSO unidirectional message is determined only by the specification for the Primary TLV.  An acknowledgment cannot be requested by including a nonzero MESSAGE ID in a message that is required according to its Primary TLV to be unidirectional.  Nor can an acknowledgment be prevented by sending a MESSAGE ID of zero in a message that is required to be a DSO request message according to its Primary TLV.  A responder that receives either such malformed message MUST treat it as a fatal error and forcibly abort the connection immediately.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.3">In a DSO request message or DSO unidirectional message, the DNS Header Query/Response (QR) bit MUST be zero (QR=0).  If the QR bit is not zero, the message is not a DSO request or DSO unidirectional message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.4">In a DSO response message, the DNS Header QR bit MUST be one (QR=1).<br> If the QR bit is not one, the message is not a DSO response message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.5">In a DSO response message (QR=1), the MESSAGE ID field MUST NOT be zero, and MUST contain a copy of the value of the (nonzero) MESSAGE ID field in the DSO request message being responded to.  If a DSO response message (QR=1) is received where the MESSAGE ID is zero, this is a fatal error and the recipient MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.2">A DSO request message or DSO unidirectional message MUST contain at least one TLV.  The first TLV in a DSO request message or DSO unidirectional message is referred to as the "Primary TLV" and determines the nature of the operation being performed, including whether it is a DSO request or a DSO unidirectional operation.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to include other TLVs in a DSO request message or DSO unidirectional message, such as the DSO Encryption Padding TLV (<a href="#padding" class="xref">Section 7.3</a>).  Additional TLVs follow the Primary TLV.  Additional TLVs are not limited to what is defined in this document.  New Additional TLVs may be defined in the future.  Their definitions will describe when their use is appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.3">An unrecognized Primary TLV results in a DSOTYPENI error response.  Unrecognized Additional TLVs are silently ignored, as described in Sections <a href="#unrecognized" class="xref">5.4.5</a> and <a href="#TLV" class="xref">8.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.4">A DSO response message may contain no TLVs, or may contain one or more TLVs, appropriate to the information being communicated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.5">Any TLVs with the same DSO-TYPE as the Primary TLV from the corresponding DSO request message are Response Primary TLV(s) and MUST appear first in a DSO response message.  A DSO response message may contain multiple Response Primary TLVs, or a single Response Primary TLV, or in some cases, no Response Primary TLV.  A Response Primary TLV is not required; for most DSO operations the MESSAGE ID field in the DNS message header is sufficient to identify the DSO request message to which a particular response message relates.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.6">Any other TLVs in a DSO response message are Response Additional TLVs, such as the DSO Encryption Padding TLV (<a href="#padding" class="xref">Section 7.3</a>).

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.7">The specification for each DSO TLV determines what TLVs are required in a response to a DSO request message using that TLV.  If a DSO response is received for an operation where the specification requires that the response carry a particular TLV or TLVs, and the required TLV(s) are not present, then this is a fatal error and the recipient of the defective response message MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.1">It is anticipated that most DSO operations will be specified to use DSO request messages, which generate corresponding DSO responses.  In some specialized high-traffic use cases, it may be appropriate to specify DSO unidirectional messages.  DSO unidirectional messages can be more efficient on the network because they don't generate a stream of corresponding reply messages.  Using DSO unidirectional messages can also simplify software in some cases by removing the need for an initiator to maintain state while it waits to receive replies it doesn't care about.  When the specification for a particular TLV used as a Primary TLV (i.e., first) in an outgoing DSO request message (i.e., QR=0) states that a message is to be unidirectional, the MESSAGE ID field MUST be set to zero and the receiver MUST NOT generate any response message corresponding to that DSO unidirectional message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.2">The previous point, that the receiver MUST NOT generate responses to DSO unidirectional messages, applies even in the case of errors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.3">When a DSO message is received where both the QR bit and the MESSAGE ID field are zero, the receiver MUST NOT generate any response.  For example, if the DSO-TYPE in the Primary TLV is unrecognized, then a DSOTYPENI error MUST NOT be returned; instead, the receiver MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.4">DSO unidirectional messages MUST NOT be used "speculatively" in cases where the sender doesn't know if the receiver supports the Primary TLV in the message because there is no way to receive any response to indicate success or failure.  DSO unidirectional messages are only appropriate in cases where the sender already knows that the receiver supports and wishes to receive these messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.5">For example, after a client has subscribed for Push Notifications <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a>, the subsequent event notifications are then sent as DSO unidirectional messages. This is appropriate because the client initiated the message stream by virtue of its Push Notification subscription, thereby indicating its support of Push Notifications and its desire to receive those notifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.3.p.6">Similarly, after a Discovery Relay client has subscribed to receive inbound multicast DNS (mDNS) <a href="#RFC6762" class="xref">[RFC6762]</a> traffic from a Discovery Relay, the subsequent stream of received packets is then sent using DSO unidirectional messages. This is appropriate because the client initiated the message stream by virtue of its Discovery Relay link subscription, thereby indicating its support of Discovery Relay and its desire to receive inbound mDNS packets over that DSO Session <a href="#Relay" class="xref">[Relay]</a>.</p>

Some DSO-TYPEs are dual-purpose and can be used as Primary TLVs in some messages, and in other messages as Additional TLVs.  The specification for a DSO-TYPE must also state whether, when used as the Primary (i.e., first) TLV in a DSO message (i.e., QR=0), that DSO message is unidirectional, or is a DSO request message that requires a response.</p>

If multiple instances of the Primary TLV are allowed the specification should clearly describe how they should be processed.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.2">With a bidirectional exchange over TCP, such as with a DSO request message, the operating system TCP implementation waits for the application-layer client software to generate the corresponding DSO response message.  The TCP implementation can then send a single combined packet containing the TCP acknowledgement, the TCP window update, and the application-generated DSO response message.  This is more efficient than sending three separate packets, as would occur if the TCP packet containing the DSO request were acknowledged immediately.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.3">With a DSO unidirectional message or DSO response message, there is no corresponding application-generated DSO response message, and consequently, no hint to the transport protocol about when it should send its acknowledgement and window update.</p>

Where available in the networking API being used, the recipient of a DSO unidirectional message or DSO response message, having parsed and interpreted the message, SHOULD then use this mechanism provided by the networking API to signal that no response for this message will be forthcoming.

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.1">The namespaces of 16-bit MESSAGE IDs are independent in each direction.  This means it is <strong>not</strong> an error for both client and server to send DSO request messages at the same time as each other, using the same MESSAGE ID, in different directions.  This simplification is necessary in order for the protocol to be implementable.  It would be infeasible to require the client and server to coordinate with each other regarding allocation of new unique MESSAGE IDs.  It is also not necessary to require the client and server to coordinate with each other regarding allocation of new unique MESSAGE IDs.  The value of the 16-bit MESSAGE ID combined with the identity of the initiator (client or server) is sufficient to unambiguously identify the operation in question.  This can be thought of as a 17-bit message identifier space using message identifiers 0x00001-0x0FFFF for client-to-server DSO request messages, and 0x10001-0x1FFFF for server-to-client DSO request messages.  The least-significant 16 bits are stored explicitly in the MESSAGE ID field of the DSO message, and the most-significant bit is implicit from the direction of the message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.2">As described in <a href="#header" class="xref">Section 5.4.1</a>, an initiator MUST NOT reuse a MESSAGE ID that it already has in use for an outstanding DSO request message (unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO-TYPE in question).  At the very least, this means that a MESSAGE ID can't be reused in a particular direction on a particular DSO Session while the initiator is waiting for a response to a previous DSO request message using that MESSAGE ID on that DSO Session (unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO-TYPE in question), and for a long-lived operation, the MESSAGE ID for the operation can't be reused while that operation remains active.</p>

This behavior is required to prevent a hypothetical attack that takes advantage of undefined behavior in this case. However, if the responder does not track MESSAGE IDs in this way, no such risk exists. Therefore, tracking MESSAGE IDs just to implement this sanity check is not required.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">The first timeout value, the inactivity timeout, is the maximum time for which a client may speculatively keep an inactive DSO Session open in the expectation that it may have future requests to send to that server.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.4">The two timeout values are independent. The inactivity timeout may be shorter, the same, or longer than the keepalive interval, though in most cases the inactivity timeout is expected to be shorter than the keepalive interval.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.5">A shorter inactivity timeout with a longer keepalive interval signals to the client that it should not speculatively keep an inactive DSO Session open for very long without reason, but when it does have an active reason to keep a DSO Session open, it doesn't need to be sending an aggressive level of DSO keepalive traffic to maintain that session.  An example of this would be a client that has subscribed to DNS Push notifications. In this case, the client is not sending any traffic to the server, but the session is not inactive because there is an active request to the server to receive push notifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.6">A longer inactivity timeout with a shorter keepalive interval signals to the client that it may speculatively keep an inactive DSO Session open for a long time, but to maintain that inactive DSO Session it should be sending a lot of DSO keepalive traffic.  This configuration is expected to be less common.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.7">In the usual case where the inactivity timeout is shorter than the keepalive interval, it is only when a client has a long-lived, low-traffic operation that the keepalive interval comes into play in order to ensure that a sufficient residual amount of traffic is generated to maintain NAT and firewall state, and to assure the client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">In addition, for as long as the client has an outstanding operation in progress, the inactivity timer remains cleared and an inactivity timeout cannot occur.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">For short-lived DNS operations like traditional queries and updates, an operation is considered "in progress" for the time between request and response, typically a period of a few hundred milliseconds at most.  At the client, the inactivity timer is cleared upon transmission of a request and remains cleared until reception of the corresponding response.  At the server, the inactivity timer is cleared upon reception of a request and remains cleared until transmission of the corresponding response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.4">For long-lived DNS Stateful Operations (such as a Push Notification subscription <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a> or a Discovery Relay interface subscription <a href="#Relay" class="xref">[Relay]</a>), an operation is considered "in progress" for as long as the operation is active, i.e., until it is canceled.  This means that a DSO Session can exist with active operations, with no messages flowing in either direction, for far longer than the inactivity timeout. This is not an error.  This is why there are two separate timers: the inactivity timeout and the keepalive interval.  Just because a DSO Session has no traffic for an extended period of time, it does not automatically make that DSO Session "inactive", if it has an active operation that is awaiting events.</p>

For example, a (hypothetical and unrealistic) keepalive interval value of 100 ms would result in a continuous stream of ten messages per second or more (if allowed by the current congestion control window) in both directions to keep the DSO Session alive.  And, in this extreme example, a single retransmission over a path with, as an example, 100 ms RTT would introduce a momentary pause in the stream of messages long enough to cause the server to abort the connection.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.1">In addition to canceling individual long-lived operations selectively (<a href="#cancellation" class="xref">Section 5.6</a>), there are also occasions where a server may need to terminate one or more entire DSO sessions.  An entire DSO session may need to be terminated if the client is defective in some way or departs from the network without closing its DSO session.  DSO Sessions may also need to be terminated if the server becomes overloaded or is reconfigured and lacks the ability to be selective about which operations need to be canceled.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.2">This section discusses various reasons a DSO session may be terminated and the mechanisms for doing so.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.3">In normal operation, closing a DSO Session is the client's responsibility.  The client makes the determination of when to close a DSO Session based on an evaluation of both its own needs and the inactivity timeout value dictated by the server.  A server only causes a DSO Session to be ended in the exceptional circumstances outlined below.  Some of the exceptional situations in which a server may terminate a DSO Session include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The server application software or underlying operating system is shutting down or restarting.</li>
<li>The server application software terminates unexpectedly (perhaps due to a bug that makes it crash, causing the underlying operating system to send a TCP RST).</li>
<li>The server is undergoing a reconfiguration or maintenance procedure that, due to the way the server software is implemented, requires clients to be disconnected.  For example, some software is implemented such that it reads a configuration file at startup, and changing the server's configuration entails modifying the configuration file and then killing and restarting the server software, which generally entails a loss of network connections.</li>
<li>The client fails to meet its obligation to generate the required DSO keepalive traffic or to close an inactive session by the prescribed time (five seconds or twice the time interval dictated by the server, whichever is greater, as described in <a href="#sessiontimeouts" class="xref">Section 6.2</a>).</li>
<li>The client sends a grossly invalid or malformed request that is indicative of a seriously defective client implementation.</li>
<li>The server is over capacity and needs to shed some load.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.p.1">In the cases described above where a server elects to terminate a DSO Session, it could do so simply by forcibly aborting the connection. However, if it did this, the likely behavior of the client might be simply to treat this as a network failure and reconnect immediately, putting more burden on the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.p.2">Therefore, to avoid this reconnection implosion, a server SHOULD instead choose to shed client load by sending a Retry Delay message with an appropriate RCODE value informing the client of the reason the DSO Session needs to be terminated.  The format of the DSO Retry Delay TLV and the interpretations of the various RCODE values are described in <a href="#delay" class="xref">Section 7.2</a>.  After sending a DSO Retry Delay message, the server MUST NOT send any further messages on that DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.p.3">The server MAY randomize retry delays in situations where many retry delays are sent in quick succession so as to avoid all the clients attempting to reconnect at once.  In general, implementations should avoid using the DSO Retry Delay message in a way that would result in many clients reconnecting at the same time if every client attempts to reconnect at the exact time specified.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.p.4">Upon receipt of a DSO Retry Delay message from the server, the client MUST make note of the reconnect delay for this server and then immediately close the connection gracefully.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.p.5">After sending a DSO Retry Delay message, the server SHOULD allow the client five seconds to close the connection, and if the client has not closed the connection after five seconds, then the server SHOULD forcibly abort the connection.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.1.p.1">At the instant a server chooses to initiate a DSO Retry Delay message, there may be DNS requests already in flight from client to server on this DSO Session, which will arrive at the server after its DSO Retry Delay message has been sent.  The server MUST silently ignore such incoming requests and MUST NOT generate any response messages for them. When the DSO Retry Delay message from the server arrives at the client, the client will determine that any DNS requests it previously sent on this DSO Session that have not yet received a response will now certainly not be receiving any response. Such requests should be considered failed and should be retried at a later time, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.1.p.2">In the case where some, but not all, of the existing operations on a DSO Session have become invalid (perhaps because the server has been reconfigured and is no longer authoritative for some of the names), but the server is terminating all affected DSO Sessions en masse by sending them all a DSO Retry Delay message, the reconnect delay MAY be zero, indicating that the clients SHOULD immediately attempt to re-establish operations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.1.p.3">It is likely that some of the attempts will be successful and some will not, depending on the nature of the reconfiguration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.1.1.p.4">In the case where a server is terminating a large number of DSO Sessions at once (e.g., if the system is restarting) and the server doesn't want to be inundated with a flood of simultaneous retries, it SHOULD send different reconnect delay values to each client.  These adjustments MAY be selected randomly, pseudorandomly, or deterministically (e.g., incrementing the time value by one tenth of a second for each successive client, yielding a post-restart reconnection rate of ten clients per second).</p>

If reconnecting to the same service instance, the client MUST respect the indicated delay, if available, before attempting to reconnect.   Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to randomize the delay; the server will randomly jitter the retry delay values it sends to each client if this behavior is desired.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.3.p.2">If a particular service instance will only be out of service for a short maintenance period, it should indicate a retry delay value that is a little longer than the expected maintenance window.  It should not default to a very large delay value, or clients may not attempt to reconnect promptly after it resumes service.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.3.p.3">If a service instance does not want a client to reconnect ever (perhaps the service instance is being decommissioned), it SHOULD set the retry delay to the maximum value 0xFFFFFFFF (2^32-1 milliseconds, approximately 49.7 days).  It is not possible to instruct a client to stay away for longer than 49.7 days.  If, after 49.7 days, the DNS or other configuration information still indicates that this is the valid service instance for a particular service, then clients MAY attempt to reconnect.  In reality, if a client is rebooted or otherwise loses state, it may well attempt to reconnect before 49.7 days elapse, for as long as the DNS or other configuration information continues to indicate that this is the service instance the client should use.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">The Keepalive TLV (DSO-TYPE=1) performs two functions.  Primarily, it establishes the values for the Session Timeouts.  Incidentally, it also resets the keepalive timer for the DSO Session, meaning that it can be used as a kind of "no-op" message for the purpose of keeping a session alive.  The client will request the desired Session Timeout values and the server will acknowledge with the response values that it requires the client to use.</p>

<dt>INACTIVITY TIMEOUT:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The inactivity timeout for the current DSO Session, specified as a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network (big endian) byte order in units of milliseconds.  This is the timeout at which the client MUST begin closing an inactive DSO Session.  The inactivity timeout can be any value of the server's choosing.  If the client does not gracefully close an inactive DSO Session, then after five seconds or twice this interval, whichever is greater, the server will forcibly abort the connection.</dd>
<dt>KEEPALIVE INTERVAL:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The keepalive interval for the current DSO Session, specified as a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network (big endian) byte order in units of milliseconds.  This is the interval at which a client MUST generate DSO keepalive traffic to maintain connection state.  The keepalive interval MUST NOT be less than ten seconds.  If the client does not generate the mandated DSO keepalive traffic, then after twice this interval the server will forcibly abort the connection.  Since the minimum allowed keepalive interval is ten seconds, the minimum time at which a server will forcibly disconnect a client for failing to generate the mandated DSO keepalive traffic is twenty seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.5">The transmission or reception of DSO Keepalive messages (i.e., messages where the Keepalive TLV is the first TLV) reset only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer.  The reason for this is that periodic DSO Keepalive messages are sent for the sole purpose of keeping a DSO Session alive when that DSO Session has current or recent non-maintenance activity that warrants keeping that DSO Session alive.  Sending DSO keepalive traffic itself is not considered a client activity; it is considered a maintenance activity that is performed in service of other client activities.  If DSO keepalive traffic itself were to reset the inactivity timer, then that would create a circular livelock where keepalive traffic would be sent indefinitely to keep a DSO Session alive. In this scenario, the only activity on that DSO Session would be the keepalive traffic keeping the DSO Session alive so that further keepalive traffic can be sent.  For a DSO Session to be considered active, it must be carrying something more than just keepalive traffic.  This is why merely sending or receiving a DSO Keepalive message does not reset the inactivity timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.6">When sent by a client, the DSO Keepalive request message MUST be sent as a DSO request message with a nonzero MESSAGE ID.  If a server receives a DSO Keepalive message with a zero MESSAGE ID, then this is a fatal error and the server MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.  The DSO Keepalive request message resets a DSO Session's keepalive timer and, at the same time, communicates to the server the client's requested Session Timeout values.  In a server response to a client-initiated DSO Keepalive request message, the Session Timeouts contain the server's chosen values from this point forward in the DSO Session, which the client MUST respect.  This is modeled after the DHCP protocol, where the client requests a certain lease lifetime using DHCP option 51 <a href="#RFC2132" class="xref">[RFC2132]</a>, but the server is the ultimate authority for deciding what lease lifetime is actually granted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.7">When a client is sending its second and subsequent DSO Keepalive request messages to the server, the client SHOULD continue to request its preferred values each time.  This allows flexibility so that if conditions change during the lifetime of a DSO Session, the server can adapt its responses to better fit the client's needs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.8">Once a DSO Session is in progress (<a href="#establishment" class="xref">Section 5.1</a>), a DSO Keepalive message MAY be initiated by a server.  When sent by a server, the DSO Keepalive message MUST be sent as a DSO unidirectional message with the MESSAGE ID set to zero.  The client MUST NOT generate a response to a server-initiated DSO Keepalive message.  If a client receives a DSO Keepalive request message with a nonzero MESSAGE ID, then this is a fatal error and the client MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.  The DSO Keepalive unidirectional message from the server resets a DSO Session's keepalive timer and, at the same time, unilaterally informs the client of the new Session Timeout values to use from this point forward in this DSO Session.  No client DSO response to this unilateral declaration is required or allowed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.9">In DSO Keepalive response messages, exactly one instance of the Keepalive TLV MUST be present and is used only as a Response Primary TLV sent as a reply to a DSO Keepalive request message from the client.  A Keepalive TLV MUST NOT be added to other responses as a Response Additional TLV.  If the server wishes to update a client's Session Timeout values other than in response to a DSO Keepalive request message from the client, then it does so by sending a DSO Keepalive unidirectional message of its own, as described above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.10">It is not required that the Keepalive TLV be used in every DSO Session.  While many DSO operations will be used in conjunction with a long-lived session state, not all DSO operations require a long-lived session state, and in some cases the default 15-second value for both the inactivity timeout and keepalive interval may be perfectly appropriate. However, note that for clients that implement only the DSO-TYPEs defined in this document, a DSO Keepalive request message is the only way for a client to initiate a DSO Session.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">When a client receives a response to its client-initiated DSO Keepalive request message, or receives a server-initiated DSO Keepalive unidirectional message, the client has then received Session Timeout values dictated by the server. The two timeout values contained in the Keepalive TLV from the server may each be higher, lower, or the same as the respective Session Timeout values the client previously had for this DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">In the case of the keepalive timer, the handling of the received value is straightforward.  The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV itself resets the keepalive timer and updates the keepalive interval for the DSO Session.  The new keepalive interval indicates the maximum time that may elapse before another message must be sent or received on this DSO Session, if the DSO Session is to remain alive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.3">In the case of the inactivity timeout, the handling of the received value is a little more subtle, though the meaning of the inactivity timeout remains as specified; it still indicates the maximum permissible time allowed without useful activity on a DSO Session.  The act of receiving the message containing the Keepalive TLV does not itself reset the inactivity timer. The time elapsed since the last useful activity on this DSO Session is unaffected by exchange of DSO Keepalive messages.  The new inactivity timeout value in the Keepalive TLV in the received message does update the timeout associated with the running inactivity timer; that becomes the new maximum permissible time without activity on a DSO Session.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>If the current inactivity timer value is less than the new inactivity timeout, then the DSO Session may remain open for now.  When the inactivity timer value reaches the new inactivity timeout, the client MUST then begin closing the DSO Session as described above.</li>
<li>If the current inactivity timer value is equal to the new inactivity timeout, then this DSO Session has been inactive for exactly as long as the server will permit, and now the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.</li>
<li>If the current inactivity timer value is already greater than the new inactivity timeout, then this DSO Session has already been inactive for longer than the server permits, and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.</li>
<li>If the current inactivity timer value is already more than twice the new inactivity timeout, then the client is immediately considered delinquent (this DSO Session is immediately eligible to be forcibly terminated by the server) and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.  However, if a server abruptly reduces the inactivity timeout in this way, then, to give the client time to close the connection gracefully before the server resorts to forcibly aborting it, the server SHOULD give the client an additional grace period of either five seconds or one quarter of the new inactivity timeout, whichever is greater.</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">We use the term "service instance" to refer to software running on a host that can receive connections on some set of { IP address, port } tuples.  What makes the software an instance is that regardless of which of these tuples the client uses to connect to it, the client is connected to the same software, running on the same logical node (see <a href="#anycast" class="xref">Section 9.2</a>), and will receive the same answers and the same keying information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">Service instances are identified from the perspective of the client.  If the client is configured with { IP address, port } tuples, it has no way to tell if the service offered at one tuple is the same server that is listening on a different tuple.   So in this case, the client treats each different tuple as if it references a different service instance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">In some cases, a client is configured with a hostname and a port number.  The port number may be given explicitly, along with the hostname.  The port number may be omitted, and assumed to have some default value.  The hostname and a port number may be learned from the network, as in the case of DNS SRV records.  In these cases, the { hostname, port } tuple uniquely identifies the service instance, subject to the usual case-insensitive DNS comparison of names <a href="#RFC1034" class="xref">[RFC1034]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.4">It is possible that two hostnames might point to some common IP addresses; this is a configuration anomaly that the client is not obliged to detect. The effect of this could be that after being told to disconnect, the client might reconnect to the same server because it is represented as a different service instance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.5">Implementations SHOULD NOT resolve hostnames and then perform the process of matching IP address(es) in order to evaluate whether two entities should be determined to be the "same service instance".</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">When an anycast service is configured on a particular IP address and port, it must be the case that although there is more than one physical server responding on that IP address, each such server can be treated as equivalent.  What we mean by "equivalent" here is that both servers can provide the same service and, where appropriate, the same authentication information, such as PKI certificates, when establishing connections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">If a change in network topology causes packets in a particular TCP connection to be sent to an anycast server instance that does not know about the connection, the new server will automatically terminate the connection with a TCP reset, since it will have no record of the connection, and then the client can reconnect or stop using the connection as appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.3">If, after the connection is re-established, the client's assumption that it is connected to the same instance is violated in some way, that would be considered an incorrect behavior in this context.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">As previously specified for DNS-over-TCP <a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a>:</p>
<pre>
   To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS
   clients MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent
   TCP connections made to any individual server.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that for any given client/server interaction there SHOULD be
   no more than one connection for regular queries, one for zone
   transfers, and one for each protocol that is being used on top
   of TCP (for example, if the resolver was using TLS). However,
   it is noted that certain primary/secondary configurations
   with many busy zones might need to use more than one TCP
   connection for zone transfers for operational reasons (for
   example, to support concurrent transfers of multiple zones).
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">A single server may support multiple services, including DNS Updates <a href="#RFC2136" class="xref">[RFC2136]</a>, DNS Push Notifications <a href="#Push" class="xref">[Push]</a>, and other services, for one or more DNS zones.  When a client discovers that the target server for several different operations is the same service instance (see <a href="#serviceinstances" class="xref">Section 9.1</a>), the client SHOULD use a single shared DSO Session for all those operations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">This requirement has two benefits.  First, it reduces unnecessary connection load on the DNS server.  Second, it avoids the connection startup time that would be spent establishing each new additional connection to the same DNS server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">However, server implementers and operators should be aware that connection sharing may not be possible in all cases.  A single host device may be home to multiple independent client software instances that don't coordinate with each other.  Similarly, multiple independent client devices behind the same NAT gateway will also typically appear to the DNS server as different source ports on the same client IP address.  Because of these constraints, a DNS server MUST be prepared to accept multiple connections from different source ports on the same client IP address.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> <a href="#operational-considerations-for-middlebox" id="operational-considerations-for-middlebox">Operational Considerations for Middleboxes</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">Where an application-layer middlebox (e.g., a DNS proxy, forwarder, or session multiplexer) is in the path, care must be taken to avoid a configuration in which DSO traffic is mishandled. The simplest way to avoid such problems is to avoid using middleboxes. When this is not possible, middleboxes should be evaluated to make sure that they behave correctly.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">Correct behavior for middleboxes consists of one of the following:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The middlebox does not forward DSO messages and responds to DSO messages with a response code other than NOERROR or DSOTYPENI.</li>
<li>The middlebox acts as a DSO server and follows this specification in establishing connections.</li>
<li>There is a 1:1 correspondence between incoming and outgoing connections such that when a connection is established to the middlebox, it is guaranteed that exactly one corresponding connection will be established from the middlebox to some DNS resolver, and all incoming messages will be forwarded without modification or reordering.   An example of this would be a NAT forwarder or TCP connection optimizer (e.g., for a high-latency connection such as a geosynchronous satellite link).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">Middleboxes that do not meet one of the above criteria are very likely to fail in unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose ways.   For example, a DNS load balancer might unbundle DNS messages from the incoming TCP stream and forward each message from the stream to a different DNS server.   If such a load balancer is in use, and the DNS servers it points to implement DSO and are configured to enable DSO, DSO Session establishment will succeed, but no coherent session will exist between the client and the server.   If such a load balancer is pointed at a DNS server that does not implement DSO or is configured not to allow DSO, no such problem will exist, but such a configuration risks unexpected failure if new server software is installed that does implement DSO.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.5">It is of course possible to implement a middlebox that properly supports DSO.  It is even possible to implement one that implements DSO with long-lived operations.  This can be done either by maintaining a 1:1 correspondence between incoming and outgoing connections, as mentioned above, or by terminating incoming sessions at the middlebox but maintaining state in the middlebox about any long-lived operations that are requested.   Specifying this in detail is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#delack" id="delack">TCP Delayed Acknowledgement Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">Most modern implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) include a feature called "Delayed Acknowledgement" <a href="#RFC1122" class="xref">[RFC1122]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">Without this feature, TCP can be very wasteful on the network.  For illustration, consider a simple example like remote login using a very simple TCP implementation that lacks delayed acks.  When the user types a keystroke, a data packet is sent.  When the data packet arrives at the server, the simple TCP implementation sends an immediate acknowledgement.  Mere milliseconds later, the server process reads the one byte of keystroke data, and consequently the simple TCP implementation sends an immediate window update.  Mere milliseconds later, the server process generates the character echo and sends this data back in reply.  The simple TCP implementation then sends this data packet immediately too.  In this case, this simple TCP implementation sends a burst of three packets almost instantaneously (ack, window update, data).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">Clearly it would be more efficient if the TCP implementation were to combine the three separate packets into one, and this is what the delayed ack feature enables.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.4">With delayed ack, the TCP implementation waits after receiving a data packet, typically for 200 ms, and then sends its ack if (a) more data packet(s) arrive, (b) the receiving process generates some reply data, or (c) 200 ms elapse without either of the above occurring.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.5">With delayed ack, remote login becomes much more efficient, generating just one packet instead of three for each character echo.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.6">The logic of delayed ack is that the 200 ms delay cannot do any significant harm.  If something at the other end were waiting for something, then the receiving process should generate the reply that the thing at the other end is waiting for, and TCP will then immediately send that reply (combined with the ack and window update).  And if the receiving process does not in fact generate any reply for this particular message, then by definition the thing at the other end cannot be waiting for anything. Therefore, the 200 ms delay is harmless.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.7">This assumption may be true unless the sender is using Nagle's algorithm, a similar efficiency feature, created to protect the network from poorly written client software that performs many rapid small writes in succession.  Nagle's algorithm allows these small writes to be coalesced into larger, less wasteful packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.8">Unfortunately, Nagle's algorithm and delayed ack, two valuable efficiency features, can interact badly with each other when used together <a href="#NagleDA" class="xref">[NagleDA]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.9">DSO request messages elicit responses; DSO unidirectional messages and DSO response messages do not.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.10">For DSO request messages, which do elicit responses, Nagle's algorithm and delayed ack work as intended.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.11">For DSO messages that do not elicit responses, the delayed ack mechanism causes the ack to be delayed by 200 ms.  The 200 ms delay on the ack can in turn cause Nagle's algorithm to prevent the sender from sending any more data for 200 ms until the awaited ack arrives.  On an enterprise Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) backbone with sub-millisecond round-trip times, a 200 ms delay is enormous in comparison.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.12">When this issues is raised, there are two solutions that are often offered, neither of them ideal:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Disable delayed ack.  For DSO messages that elicit no response, removing delayed ack avoids the needless 200 ms delay and sends back an immediate ack that tells Nagle's algorithm that it should immediately grant the sender permission to send its next packet.  Unfortunately, for DSO messages that <strong>do</strong> elicit a response, removing delayed ack removes the efficiency gains of combining acks with data, and the responder will now send two or three packets instead of one.</li>
<li>Disable Nagle's algorithm.  When acks are delayed by the delayed ack algorithm, removing Nagle's algorithm prevents the sender from being blocked from sending its next small packet immediately.  Unfortunately, on a network with a higher round-trip time, removing Nagle's algorithm removes the efficiency gains of combining multiple small packets into fewer larger ones, with the goal of limiting the number of small packets in flight at any one time.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.14">The problem here is that with DSO messages that elicit no response, the TCP implementation is stuck waiting, unsure if a response is about to be generated or whether the TCP implementation should go ahead and send an ack and window update.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.15">The solution is networking APIs that allow the receiver to inform the TCP implementation that a received message has been read, processed, and no response for this message will be generated.  TCP can then stop waiting for a response that will never come, and immediately go ahead and send an ack and window update.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.16">For implementations of DSO, disabling delayed ack is NOT RECOMMENDED because of the harm this can do to the network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.17">For implementations of DSO, disabling Nagle's algorithm is NOT RECOMMENDED because of the harm this can do to the network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.18">At the time that this document is being prepared for publication, it is known that at least one TCP implementation provides the ability for the recipient of a TCP message to signal that it is not going to send a response, and hence the delayed ack mechanism can stop waiting.  Implementations on operating systems where this feature is available SHOULD make use of it.</p>

There is no need for IANA to review such assignments (since IANA does not record them) and assignments are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is the responsibility of the sites making use of "experimental/local" values to ensure that no conflicts occur within the intended scope of use.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.8">Any document defining a new TLV that lists a value of "OK" in the Early Data column must include a threat analysis for the use of the TLV in the case of TLS zero round-trip.  See <a href="#zrtt" class="xref">Section 11.1</a> for details.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">If this mechanism is to be used with DNS-over-TLS, then these messages are subject to the same constraints as any other DNS-over-TLS messages and MUST NOT be sent in the clear before the TLS session is established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">The data field of the "Encryption Padding" TLV could be used as a covert channel.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">When designing new DSO TLVs, the potential for data in the TLV to be used as a tracking identifier should be taken into consideration and should be avoided when not required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">When used without TLS or similar cryptographic protection, a malicious entity may be able to inject a malicious unidirectional DSO Retry Delay message into the data stream, specifying an unreasonably large RETRY DELAY, causing a denial-of-service attack against the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.5">The establishment of DSO Sessions has an impact on the number of open TCP connections on a DNS server. Additional resources may be used on the server as a result. However, because the server can limit the number of DSO Sessions established and can also close existing DSO Sessions as needed, denial of service or resource exhaustion should not be a concern.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.11.1">11.1.</a> <a href="#zrtt" id="zrtt">TLS Zero Round-Trip Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.1">DSO permits zero round-trip operation using TCP Fast Open with TLS&#160;1.3 <a href="#RFC8446" class="xref">[RFC8446]</a> early data to reduce or eliminate round trips in session establishment.  TCP Fast Open is only permitted in combination with TLS&#160;1.3 early data.  In the rest of this section, we refer to TLS 1.3 early data in a TLS zero round-trip initial handshake message, regardless of whether or not it is included in a TCP SYN packet with early data using the TCP Fast Open option, as "early data."</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.2">A DSO message may or may not be permitted to be sent as early data.  The definition for each TLV that can be used as a Primary TLV is required to state whether or not that TLV is permitted as early data.  Only response-requiring messages are ever permitted as early data, and only clients are permitted to send a DSO message as early data unless there is an implicit DSO session (see <a href="#establishment" class="xref">Section 5.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.3">For DSO messages that are permitted as early data, a client MAY include one or more such messages as early data without having to wait for a DSO response to the first DSO request message to confirm successful establishment of a DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.4">However, unless there is an implicit DSO session, a client MUST NOT send DSO unidirectional messages until after a DSO Session has been mutually established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.5">Similarly, unless there is an implicit DSO session, a server MUST NOT send DSO request messages until it has received a response-requiring DSO request message from a client and transmitted a successful NOERROR response for that request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.6">Caution must be taken to ensure that DSO messages sent as early data are idempotent or are otherwise immune to any problems that could result from the inadvertent replay that can occur with zero round-trip operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.7">It would be possible to add a TLV that requires the server to do some significant work and send that to the server as initial data in a TCP SYN packet.   A flood of such packets could be used as a DoS attack on the server.   None of the TLVs defined here have this property.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.8">If a new TLV is specified that does have this property, that TLV must be specified as not permitted in zero round-trip messages.  This prevents work from being done until a round-trip has occurred from the server to the client to verify that the source address of the packet is reachable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.9">Documents that define new TLVs must state whether each new TLV may be sent as early data.  Such documents must include a threat analysis in the security considerations section for each TLV defined in the document that may be sent as early data.  This threat analysis should be done based on the advice given in Sections 2.3, 8, and Appendix E.5 of the TLS 1.3 specification <a href="#RFC8446" class="xref">[RFC8446]</a>.</p>
