    <abstract>


<t>This document defines a new DNS OPCODE for DNS Stateful Operations (DSO).
DSO messages communicate operations within persistent
stateful sessions, using type-length-value (TLV) syntax.
Three TLVs are defined that manage session timeouts,
termination, and encryption padding, and 
a framework is defined for extensions to enable new stateful operations.
This document updates RFC 1035 by adding a new DNS header opcode and result code which has different message semantics.  This document updates RFC 7766 by redefining a session, providing new guidance on connection re-use, and providing a new mechanism for handling session idle timeouts.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The use of transports for DNS other than UDP is being increasingly specified,
for example, DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/> <xref target="RFC7766"/> and DNS over TLS <xref target="RFC7858"/>.
Such transports can offer persistent, long-lived sessions and therefore when
using them for transporting DNS messages it is of benefit to have a mechanism
that can establish parameters associated with those sessions, such as timeouts.
In such situations it is also advantageous to support server-initiated messages
(such as DNS Push Notifications <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>).</t>

<t>The existing EDNS(0) Extension Mechanism for DNS <xref target="RFC6891"/> is explicitly
defined to only have “per-message” semantics. While EDNS(0) has been used to
signal at least one session-related parameter (edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option
<xref target="RFC7828"/>) the result is less than optimal due to the restrictions
imposed by the EDNS(0) semantics and the lack of server-initiated signalling. 
For example, a server cannot arbitrarily 
instruct a client to close a connection because the server can only send EDNS(0) options 
in responses to queries that contained EDNS(0) options.</t>

<t>This document defines a new DNS OPCODE, DSO ([TBA1], tentatively 6), for DNS Stateful Operations.
DSO messages are used to communicate operations within persistent
stateful sessions, expressed using type-length-value (TLV) syntax.
This document defines an initial set of three TLVs,
used to manage session timeouts, termination, and encryption padding.</t>

<t>The three TLVs defined here are all mandatory for all implementations of DSO.
Further TLVs may be defined in additional specifications.</t>

<t>DSO messages may or may not be acknowledged; this is signaled by providing a
non-zero message ID for messages that must be acknowledged and a zero message
ID for messages that are not to be acknowledged, and is also part of the definition
of a particular message type.   Messages are pipelined; answers may appear out
of order when more than one answer is pending.</t>

<t>The format for DSO messages
(<xref target="format"/>) differs somewhat from the traditional DNS message
format used for standard queries and responses.
The standard twelve-byte header is used, but the four count fields
(QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) are set to zero and accordingly their
corresponding sections are not present.</t>

<t>The actual data pertaining to DNS Stateful Operations
(expressed in TLV syntax) is appended to the end of the DNS message header.
The stream protocol carrying the DSO message frames it with 16-bit message length, so
the length of the DSO data is determined from that length, rather than from any of
the DNS header counts.</t>

<t>When displayed using packet analyzer tools that have not been
updated to recognize the DSO format, this
will result in the DSO data being displayed
as unknown additional data after the end of the DNS message.</t>

<t>This new format has distinct advantages over an RR-based format because it
is more explicit and more compact. Each TLV definition is specific
to its use case, and as a result contains no redundant or overloaded fields.
Importantly, it completely avoids conflating DNS Stateful Operations in any way 
with normal DNS operations or with existing EDNS(0)-based functionality.
A goal of this approach is to avoid the operational issues that have
befallen EDNS(0), particularly relating to middlebox behaviour (see for example
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-no-response-issue"/> sections 3.2 and 4).</t>

<t>With EDNS(0), multiple options may be packed into a single OPT pseudo-RR,
and there is no generalized mechanism for a client to be able to tell
whether a server has processed or otherwise acted upon each individual
option within the combined OPT pseudo-RR.
The specifications for each individual option need to define how each
different option is to be acknowledged, if necessary.</t>

<t>In contrast to EDNS(0), with DSO there is no
compelling motivation to pack multiple operations into a single
message for efficiency reasons, because DSO
always operates using a connection-oriented transport protocol.
Each DSO operation is communicated in its own separate
DNS message, and the transport protocol can take care of packing
several DNS messages into a single IP packet if appropriate.
For example, TCP can pack multiple small DNS messages into a single TCP segment.
This simplification allows for clearer semantics.
Each DSO request message communicates just one primary operation,
and the RCODE in the corresponding response message indicates the
success or failure of that operation.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-language" title="Requirements Language">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>“DSO” is used to mean DNS Stateful Operation.</t>

<t>The term “connection” means a bidirectional byte (or message) stream,
where the bytes (or messages) are delivered reliably and in-order,
such as provided by using
DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/> <xref target="RFC7766"/> or DNS over TLS <xref target="RFC7858"/>.</t>

<t>The unqualified term “session” in the context of this document means the exchange of
DNS messages over a connection where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The connection between client and server is persistent and relatively
long-lived.</t>
  <t>Either end of the connection may initiate messages to the other.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In this document the term “session” is used exclusively as described above.
The term has no relationship to the “session layer” of the
OSI “seven-layer model”.</t>

<t>A “DSO Session” is established between two endpoints that acknowledge
persistent DNS state via the exchange of DSO messages over the connection.
This is distinct from a DNS-over-TCP session as described in
the previous specification for DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC7766"/>.</t>

<t>A “DSO Session” is terminated when the underlying connection is closed.
The underlying connection can be closed in two ways:</t>

<t>Where this specification says, “close gracefully,”
that means sending a TLS close_notify (if TLS is in use) followed by a TCP FIN,
or the equivalents for other protocols.
Where this specification requires a connection to be closed gracefully,
the requirement to initiate that graceful close is placed on the client,
to place the burden of TCP’s TIME-WAIT state on the client rather than the server.</t>

<t>Where this specification says, “forcibly abort,”
that means sending a TCP RST,
or the equivalent for other protocols.
In the BSD Sockets API this is achieved by setting the
SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.</t>

<t>The term “server” means the software with a listening socket, awaiting
incoming connection requests in the usual DNS sense.</t>

<t>The term “client” means the software which initiates a connection
to the server’s listening socket in the usual DNS sense.</t>

<t>The terms “initiator” and “responder” correspond respectively to the
initial sender and subsequent receiver of a DSO request message or unacknowledged message,
regardless of which was the “client” and “server” in the usual DNS sense.</t>

<t>The term “sender” may apply to
either an initiator (when sending a DSO request message or unacknowledged message)
or a responder (when sending a DSO response message).</t>

<t>Likewise, the term “receiver” may apply to
either a responder (when receiving a DSO request message or unacknowledged message)
or an initiator (when receiving a DSO response message).</t>

<t>In protocol implementation there are generally two kinds of errors
that software writers have to deal with.
The first is situations that arise due to factors in the environment,
such as temporary loss of connectivity. While undesirable, these
situations do not indicate a flaw in the software, and they are
situations that software should generally be able to recover from.
The second is situations that should never happen when communicating
with a correctly-implemented peer.
If they do happen, they indicate a serious flaw in the protocol implementation,
beyond what it is reasonable to expect software to recover from.
This document describes this latter form of error condition as a
“fatal error” and specifies that an implementation encountering
a fatal error condition “MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately”.
Given that these fatal error conditions signify defective software,
and given that defective software is likely to remain defective for
some time until it is fixed, after forcibly aborting a connection,
a client SHOULD refrain from automatically reconnecting to that
same service instance for at least one hour.</t>

<t>This document uses the term “same service instance” as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>In cases where a server is specified or configured using
an IP address and TCP port number,
two different configurations are referring to the same service instance if they
contain the same IP address and TCP port number.</t>
  <t>In cases where a server is specified or configured using
a hostname and TCP port number,
such as in the content of a DNS SRV record <xref target="RFC2782"/>,
two different configurations (or DNS SRV records) are considered
to be referring to the same service instance if they
contain the same hostname (subject to the usual case insensitive
DNS name matching rules <xref target="RFC1034"/> <xref target="RFC1035"/>) and TCP port number.
In these cases, configurations with different hostnames are considered
to be referring to different service instances, even if those different hostnames
happen to be aliases, or happen to resolve to the same IP address(es).
Implementations SHOULD NOT resolve hostnames and then
perform matching of IP address(es) in order to evaluate whether
two entities should be determined to be the “same service instance”.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When an anycast service is configured on a particular IP address and port, it
must be the case that although there is more than one physical server
responding on that IP address, each such server can be treated as equivalent.
If a change in network topology causes
packets in a particular TCP connection to be sent to an anycast
server instance that does not know about the connection, the new
server will automatically terminate the connection with a TCP reset,
since it will have no record of the connection, and then the client can
reconnect or stop using the connection, as appropriate.</t>

<t>If after the connection is re-established, the client’s assumption that it is
connected to the same service is violated in some way, that would be considered
to be incorrect behavior in this context. It is however out of the possible
scope for this specification to make specific recommendations in this regard;
that would be up to follow-on documents that describe specific uses of DNS
stateful operations.</t>

<t>The term “long-lived operations” refers to operations
such as Push Notification subscriptions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>,
Discovery Relay interface subscriptions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>,
and other future long-lived DNS operations that choose to use
DSO as their basis. These operations establish state that persists beyond
the lifetime of a traditional brief request/response transaction.
This document, the base specification for DNS Stateful Operations,
defines a framework for supporting long-lived operations,
but does not itself define any long-lived operations.
Nonetheless, to appreciate the design rationale behind
DNS Stateful Operations, it is helpful to understand
the kind of long-lived operations that it is intended to support.</t>

<t>DNS Stateful Operations uses three kinds of message:
“DSO request messages”, “DSO response messages”, and
“DSO unacknowledged messages”.
A DSO request message elicits a DSO response message.
DSO unacknowledged messages are unidirectional messages and do not induce a DNS response.</t>

<t>Both DSO request messages and DSO unacknowledged messages are formatted as DNS
request messages (the header QR bit is set to zero, as described in <xref target="format"/>).
One difference is that in DSO request messages the MESSAGE ID field is nonzero;
in DSO unacknowledged messages it is zero.</t>

<t>The content of DSO messages is expressed using type-length-value (TLV) syntax.</t>

<t>In a DSO request message or DSO unacknowledged message
the first TLV is referred to as the “Primary TLV”
and determines the nature of the operation being performed,
including whether it is an acknowledged or unacknowledged operation;
any other TLVs in a DSO request message or unacknowledged message are referred to as “Additional TLVs”
and serve additional non-primary purposes, which may be related to
the primary purpose, or not, as in the case of the encryption padding TLV.</t>

<t>A DSO response message may contain no TLVs, or it may contain one
or more TLVs as appropriate to the information being communicated.
In the context of DSO response messages,
one or more TLVs with the same DSO-TYPE as the Primary TLV in the
corresponding DSO request message are referred to as “Response Primary TLVs”.
Any other TLVs with different DSO-TYPEs are referred to as “Response Additional TLVs”.
The Response Primary TLV(s), if present, MUST occur first in the response message,
before any Response Additional TLVs.</t>

<t>Two timers (elapsed time since an event) are defined in this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>an inactivity timer (see <xref target="inactivetimer"/> and <xref target="keepalive"/>)</t>
  <t>a keepalive timer (see <xref target="keepalivetimer"/> and <xref target="keepalive"/>)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The timeouts associated with these timers are called
the inactivity timeout and 
the keepalive interval, respectively. 
The term “Session Timeouts” is used to refer to this pair of timeout values.</t>

<t>Resetting a timer means resetting the timer value to zero and starting the timer again.
Clearing a timer means resetting the timer value to zero but NOT starting the timer again.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

</section>
<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">

<t>There are several use cases for DNS Stateful operations that can 
be described here.</t>

<t>Firstly, establishing session parameters such as server-defined timeouts is of 
great use in the 
general management of persistent connections. For example, using DSO sessions 
for stub-to-recursive DNS-over-TLS <xref target="RFC7858"/> is more flexible for both the 
client and the server than attempting to manage sessions using just the
edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option <xref target="RFC7828"/>.
The simple set of TLVs defined in this document is
sufficient to greatly enhance connection management for this use case.</t>

<t>Secondly, DNS-SD <xref target="RFC6763"/> has evolved into a naturally session-based mechanism where,
for example, long-lived subscriptions lend themselves to ‘push’ mechanisms as 
opposed to polling. Long-lived stateful connections and server-initiated 
messages align with this use case <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>.</t>

<t>A general use case is that DNS traffic is often bursty but session establishment 
can be expensive. One challenge with long-lived connections is to maintain 
sufficient traffic to maintain NAT and firewall state.
To mitigate this issue this document introduces a
new concept for the DNS, that is DSO “Keepalive traffic”.
This traffic carries no DNS data and is not considered ‘activity’
in the classic DNS sense, but serves to maintain state in middleboxes,
and to assure client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

</section>
<section anchor="details" title="Protocol Details">

<section anchor="establishment" title="DSO Session Establishment">

<t>DSO messages MUST NOT be carried in protocols and
environments where a session can’t be established.   For example,
DNS over plain UDP <xref target="RFC0768"/> is not appropriate since it does not provide
in-order message delivery, and, in the presence of NAT gateways and firewalls
with short UDP timeouts, it cannot provide a persistent bi-directional
communication channel unless an excessive amount of DSO keepalive traffic is used.
UDP also doesn’t provide a way to mark the start of a session and the end
of a session.</t>

<t>At the time of publication, DSO is specified only
for DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/> <xref target="RFC7766"/>, and
for DNS over TLS over TCP <xref target="RFC7858"/>.
Any use of DSO over some other connection technology needs to be
specified in an appropriate future document.</t>

<t>Determining whether a given connection is using DNS over TCP, or DNS
over TLS over TCP, is outside the scope of this specification, and
must be determined using some out-of-band configuration information.
There is no provision within the DSO specification to
turn TLS on or off during the lifetime of a connection.
For service types where the service instance is discovered
using a DNS SRV record <xref target="RFC2782"/>,
the specification for that service type SRV name <xref target="RFC6335"/>
will state whether the connection uses plain TCP, or TLS over TCP.
For example, the specification for the
“_dns‑push‑tls._tcp” service <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>,
states that it uses TLS.
It is a common convention that protocols specified to run over TLS
are given IANA service type names ending in “‑tls” <xref target="IANA-SRVNAMES"/>.</t>

<t>In some environments it may be known in advance by external means
that both client and server support DSO, and in these cases either
client or server may initiate DSO messages at any time.</t>

<t>However, in the typical case a server will not know in advance whether a
client supports DSO, so in general, unless it is known in advance by other means
that a client does support DSO, a server MUST NOT initiate DSO request messages
or DSO unacknowledged messages
until a DSO Session has been mutually established
by at least one successful DSO request/response exchange
initiated by the client, as described below.
Similarly, unless it is known in advance by other means that a server
does support DSO, a client MUST NOT initiate
DSO unacknowledged messages until after a DSO Session has been mutually established.</t>

<t>A DSO Session is established over a connection by the client
sending a DSO request message, such as a DSO Keepalive request message (<xref target="keepalive"/>),
and receiving a response, with matching MESSAGE ID, and RCODE
set to NOERROR (0), indicating that the DSO request was successful.</t>

<t>If the RCODE in the response is set to DSOTYPENI
(“DSO-TYPE Not Implemented”, [TBA2] tentatively RCODE 11)
this indicates that the server does support DSO, but does not implement
the DSO-TYPE of the primary TLV in this DSO request message.
A server implementing DSO MUST NOT return DSOTYPENI
for a DSO Keepalive request message, because the Keepalive TLV is mandatory to implement.
But in the future, if a client attempts to establish a DSO Session
using a response-requiring DSO request message using some newly-defined DSO-TYPE that the server
does not understand, that would result in a DSOTYPENI response.
If the server returns DSOTYPENI then a DSO Session is not
considered established, but the client is permitted to continue
sending DNS messages on the connection,
including other DSO messages such as the DSO Keepalive,
which may result in a successful NOERROR response,
yielding the establishment of a DSO Session.</t>

<t>If the RCODE is set to any value other than NOERROR (0) or DSOTYPENI
([TBA2] tentatively 11), then the client MUST assume that the server does
not implement DSO at all. In this case the client is permitted to continue
sending DNS messages on that connection, but the client MUST NOT
issue further DSO messages on that connection.</t>

<t>Two other possibilities exist: the server might drop the connection, or
the server might send no response to the DSO message.   In the first
case, the client SHOULD mark the server as not supporting DSO, and not
attempt a DSO connection for some period of time (at least an hour)
after the failed attempt.   The client MAY reconnect but not use
DSO, if appropriate.</t>

<t>In the second case, the client SHOULD set a reasonable timeout, after
which time the server will be assumed not to support DSO.   At this
point the client MUST drop the connection to the server, since the
server’s behavior is out of spec, and hence its state is undefined.
The client MAY reconnect, but not use DSO, if appropriate.</t>

<t>When the server receives a DSO request message
from a client, and transmits a successful NOERROR response to that
request, the server considers the DSO Session established.</t>

<t>When the client receives the server’s NOERROR response to its
DSO request message, the client considers the DSO Session established.</t>

<t>Once a DSO Session has been established,
either end may unilaterally send appropriate DSO messages at any time,
and therefore either client or server may be the initiator of a message.</t>

<t>Once a DSO Session has been established,
clients and servers should behave as described in this specification with
regard to inactivity timeouts and session termination, not as previously
prescribed in the earlier specification for DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC7766"/>.</t>

<t>Because the Keepalive TLV can’t fail (that is, can’t return an RCODE
other than NOERROR), it is an ideal candidate for use in establishing
a DSO session.   Any other option that can only succeed MAY also be
used to establish a DSO session.
For clients that implement only the DSO-TYPEs defined in
this base specification, sending a Keepalive TLV is the only
DSO request message they have available to initiate a DSO Session.
Even for clients that do implement other future DSO-TYPEs, for simplicity
they MAY elect to always send an initial DSO Keepalive
request message as their way of initiating a DSO Session.
A future definition of a new response-requiring DSO-TYPE
gives implementers the option of using that new DSO-TYPE if they wish,
but does not change the fact that sending a Keepalive TLV
remains a valid way of initiating a DSO Session.</t>

<section anchor="sharing" title="Connection Sharing">

<t>As previously specified for DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC7766"/>:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS
   clients MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent
   TCP connections made to any individual server.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that for any given client/server interaction there SHOULD be
   no more than one connection for regular queries, one for zone
   transfers, and one for each protocol that is being used on top
   of TCP (for example, if the resolver was using TLS). However,
   it is noted that certain primary/secondary configurations
   with many busy zones might need to use more than one TCP
   connection for zone transfers for operational reasons (for
   example, to support concurrent transfers of multiple zones).
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>A single server may support multiple services, including DNS Updates 
<xref target="RFC2136"/>, DNS Push Notifications <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>,
and other services, for one or more DNS zones.
When a client discovers that the target server for several different operations
is the same target hostname and port, the client SHOULD use a single
shared DSO Session for all those operations.
A client SHOULD NOT open multiple connections to the same target host and port
just because the names being operated on are different or
happen to fall within different zones.
This requirement has two benefits.
First, it reduces unnecessary connection load on the DNS server.
Second, it avoids paying the TCP slow start penalty when making subsequent
connections to the same server.</t>

<t>However, server implementers and operators should be aware that connection
sharing may not be possible in all cases.
A single host device may be home to multiple independent client software
instances that don’t coordinate with each other.
Similarly, multiple independent client devices behind the same NAT gateway
will also typically appear to the DNS server as different source ports on
the same client IP address.
Because of these constraints, a DNS server MUST be prepared to accept
multiple connections from different source ports on the same client IP address.</t>

<section anchor="zero-round-trip-operation" title="Zero Round-Trip Operation">

<t>DSO permits zero round-trip operation
using TCP Fast Open <xref target="RFC7413"/>
and TLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/>
to reduce or eliminate
round trips in session establishment.</t>

<t>A client MAY send multiple response-requiring DSO messages using TCP fast
open or TLS 1.3 early data,
without having to wait for a response to the first request message
to confirm successful establishment of a DSO session.</t>

<t>However, a client MUST NOT send non-response-requiring DSO request
messages until after a DSO Session has been mutually established.</t>

<t>Similarly, a server MUST NOT send DSO request messages until it
has received a response-requiring DSO request message from a
client and transmitted a successful NOERROR response for that request.</t>

<t>Caution must be taken to ensure that DSO messages sent before the first
round-trip is completed are idempotent, or are otherwise immune to any problems
that could be result from the inadvertent replay that can occur with zero round-trip operation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="middlebox-considerations" title="Middlebox Considerations">

<t>Where an application-layer middlebox (e.g., a DNS proxy, forwarder,
or session multiplexer) is in the path, care must be taken to avoid
inappropriately passing session signaling through the middlebox.</t>

<t>In cases where a DSO session is terminated on one side of a middlebox,
and then some session is opened on the other side of the middlebox in
order to satisfy requests sent over the first DSO session, any such session
MUST be treated as a separate session. If the middlebox does implement DSO
sessions, it MUST handle unrecognized TLVs in the same way as any other DSO implementation as described below in <xref target="unrecognized"/>.</t>

<t>This does not
preclude the use of DSO messages in the presence of an IP-layer
middlebox, such as a NAT that rewrites IP-layer and/or transport-
layer headers but otherwise preserves the effect of a single session
between the client and the server.  And of course it does not apply
to middleboxes that do not implement DNS Stateless Operations.</t>

<t>These restrictions do not apply to such middleboxes:
since they have no way to understand a DSO message, a pass-through
middlebox like the one described in the previous paragraph will pass
DSO messages unchanged or drop them (or possibly drop the connection).
A middlebox that is not doing a strict pass-through will have no way
to know on which connection to forward a DSO message, and therefore
will not be able to behave incorrectly.</t>

<t>To illustrate the above, consider a network where a middlebox
terminates one or more TCP connections from clients and multiplexes the
queries therein over a single TCP connection to an upstream server.
The DSO messages and any associated state are specific to the individual
TCP connections.  A DSO-aware middlebox MAY in some circumstances be
able to retain associated state and pass it between the client and
server (or vice versa) but this would be highly TLV-specific.  For
example, the middlebox may be able to maintain a list of which clients
have made Push Notification subscriptions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> and
make its own subscription(s) on their behalf, relaying any subsequent
notifications to the client (or clients) that have subscribed to that
particular notification.</t>

<section anchor="header" title="DNS Header Fields in DSO Messages">

<t>In an unacknowledged message the MESSAGE ID field MUST be set to zero.
In an acknowledged request message the MESSAGE ID field MUST
be set to a unique nonzero value, that the initiator is not
currently using for any other active operation on this connection.
For the purposes here, a MESSAGE ID is in use in this DSO Session if the
initiator has used it in a request for which it is still awaiting a response,
or if the client has used it to set up a long-lived operation that has not yet been cancelled.
For example, a long-lived operation could be
a Push Notification subscription <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> or
a Discovery Relay interface subscription <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>.</t>

<t>Whether a message is acknowledged or unacknowledged is
determined only by the specification for the Primary TLV.
An acknowledgment cannot be requested by including a nonzero message ID
in a message the primary TLV of which is specified to be unacknowledged,
nor can an acknowledgment be prevented by sending a message ID of zero
in a message with a primary TLV that is specified to be acknowledged.
A responder that receives either such malformed message MUST treat it
as a fatal error and forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>In a request or unacknowledged message the DNS Header QR bit MUST be zero (QR=0).
If the QR bit is not zero the message is not a request or unacknowledged message.</t>

<t>In a response message the DNS Header QR bit MUST be one (QR=1).<vspace />
If the QR bit is not one the message is not a response message.</t>

<t>In a response message (QR=1) the MESSAGE ID field MUST contain a copy of the value of
the MESSAGE ID field in the request message being responded to.
In a response message (QR=1) the MESSAGE ID field MUST NOT be zero.
If a response message (QR=1) is received where the MESSAGE ID is zero
this is a fatal error and the recipient MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>The DNS Header OPCODE field holds the DSO OPCODE value ([TBA1] tentatively 6).</t>

<t>The Z bits are currently unused in DSO messages,
and in both DSO requests and DSO responses the
Z bits MUST be set to zero (0) on transmission and MUST be silently ignored
on reception.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

<t>In a DNS request message (QR=0) the RCODE is set according to the definition of the request.
For example, in a Retry Delay message (<xref target="retry"/>) the RCODE indicates the reason for termination.
However, in most cases, except where clearly specified otherwise,
in a DNS request message (QR=0) the RCODE is set to zero on transmission,
and silently ignored on reception.</t>

<t>The RCODE value in a response message (QR=1) may be one of the following values:</t>

<section anchor="dsodata" title="DSO Data">

<t>The standard twelve-byte DNS message header with its
zero-valued count fields is followed by the DSO Data,
expressed using TLV syntax, as described below <xref target="tlvsyntax"/>.</t>

<t>A DSO request message or DSO unacknowledged message MUST contain at least one TLV.
The first TLV in a DSO request message or DSO unacknowledged message is referred to as the “Primary TLV”
and determines the nature of the operation being performed,
including whether it is an acknowledged or unacknowledged operation.
In some cases it may be appropriate to include other TLVs in a request message or unacknowledged message,
such as the Encryption Padding TLV (<xref target="padding"/>),
and these extra TLVs are referred to as the “Additional TLVs” and are not limited to what is defined in this document. New “Additional TLVs” may be defined in the future and those definitions will describe when their use is appropriate.</t>

<t>A DSO response message may contain no TLVs, or it may be specified to
contain one or more TLVs appropriate to the information being
communicated.  This includes “Primary TLVs” and “Additional TLVs”
defined in this document as well as in future TLV definitions.
It may be permissible for an additional TLV to appear in a response
to a primary TLV even though the specification of that primary TLV
does not specify it explicitly.  See <xref target="TLV"/> for more information.</t>

<t>A DSO response message may contain one or more TLVs with
DSO-TYPE the same as the Primary TLV from the corresponding DSO request message,
in which case those TLV(s) are referred to as “Response Primary TLVs”.
A DSO response message is not required to carry Response Primary TLVs.
The MESSAGE ID field in the DNS message header is sufficient to identify
the DSO request message to which this response message relates.</t>

<t>A DSO response message may contain one or more TLVs with
DSO-TYPEs different from the Primary TLV from the corresponding DSO request message,
in which case those TLV(s) are referred to as “Response Additional TLVs”.</t>

<t>Response Primary TLV(s), if present, MUST occur first in the response message,
before any Response Additional TLVs.</t>

<t>It is anticipated that most DSO operations will be specified
to use request messages, which generate corresponding responses.
In some specialized high-traffic use cases,
it may be appropriate to specify unacknowledged messages.
Unacknowledged messages can be more efficient on the network,
because they don’t generate a stream of corresponding reply messages.
Using unacknowledged messages can also simplify software
in some cases, by removing need for an initiator to maintain
state while it waits to receive replies it doesn’t care about.
When the specification for a particular TLV states that,
when used as a Primary TLV (i.e., first) in an outgoing DNS request message (i.e., QR=0),
that message is to be unacknowledged,
the MESSAGE ID field MUST be set to zero and
the receiver MUST NOT generate any response message
corresponding to this unacknowledged message.</t>

<t>The previous point, that the receiver MUST NOT generate responses to
unacknowledged messages, applies even in the case of errors.
When a DSO message is received where both the QR bit and the MESSAGE ID field
are zero, the receiver MUST NOT generate any response.
For example, if the DSO-TYPE in the Primary TLV is unrecognized,
then a DSOTYPENI error MUST NOT be returned; instead the receiver
MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>Unacknowledged messages MUST NOT be used “speculatively”
in cases where the sender doesn’t know if the receiver supports
the Primary TLV in the message, because there is no way to receive
any response to indicate success or failure.
Unacknowledged messages are only appropriate in cases
where the sender already knows that the receiver supports,
and wishes to receive, these messages.</t>

<t>For example, after a client has subscribed for Push Notifications
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/>, the subsequent event notifications are
then sent as unacknowledged messages, and this is appropriate
because the client initiated the message stream by virtue of its
Push Notification subscription, thereby indicating its support of
Push Notifications, and its desire to receive those notifications.</t>

<t>Similarly, after a Discovery Relay client has subscribed to receive
inbound mDNS (multicast DNS, <xref target="RFC6762"/>) traffic from a Discovery
Relay, the subsequent stream of received
packets is then sent using unacknowledged messages, and this
is appropriate because the client initiated the message stream
by virtue of its Discovery Relay link subscription, thereby indicating
its support of Discovery Relay, and its desire to receive inbound mDNS
packets over that DSO session <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

<section anchor="tlvsyntax" title="TLV Syntax">

<t>All TLVs, whether used as “Primary”, “Additional”, “Response Primary”,
or “Response Additional”, use the same encoding syntax.</t>

<t>When a new TLV is defined, the specification MUST include whether the DSO-TYPE
can be used as the Primary TLV, used as an Additional TLV, or used in either
context for both requests and responses.
The specification for a TLV also states whether,
when used as the Primary (i.e., first) TLV in a DNS request message (i.e., QR=0),
that DSO message is to be acknowledged.
If the DSO message is to be acknowledged, the specification
also states which TLVs, if any, are to be included in the response.
The Primary TLV may or may not be contained in the response,
depending on what is stated in the specification for that TLV.</t>

If functionality provided by current or future EDNS(0) options

need to be defined to carry the necessary information.</t>

<t>For example, the EDNS(0) Padding Option <xref target="RFC7830"/> used for security purposes

<t>Similarly, a DSO message MUST NOT contain a TSIG record.
A TSIG record in a conventional DNS message is added as the last record in

<t>Note however that, while DSO <spanx style="strong">messages</spanx> cannot include
EDNS(0) or TSIG records, a DSO <spanx style="strong">session</spanx> is typically used to

identity of the initiator (client or server) is sufficient
to unambiguously identify the operation in question.
This can be thought of as a 17-bit message identifier space, using
message identifiers 0x00001-0x0FFFF for client-to-server DSO request messages, and
message identifiers 0x10001-0x1FFFF for server-to-client DSO request messages.
The least-significant 16 bits are stored explicitly in the
MESSAGE ID field of the DSO message, and the most-significant
bit is implicit from the direction of the message.</t>

<t>As described above in <xref target="header"/>, an initiator MUST NOT reuse a
MESSAGE ID that it already has in use for an outstanding request
(unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO-TYPE in question).
At the very least, this means that a MESSAGE ID can’t
be reused in a particular direction on a particular DSO
Session while the initiator is waiting for a response to a
previous request using that MESSAGE ID on that DSO Session
(unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO-TYPE in question),
and for a long-lived operation the MESSAGE ID for the operation
can’t be reused while that operation remains active.</t>

<t>If a client or server receives a response (QR=1) where the MESSAGE ID is zero, or is
any other value that does not match the MESSAGE ID of any of its outstanding operations,
this is a fatal error and the recipient MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>If a responder receives a request (QR=0) where the MESSAGE ID is not zero, and
the responder tracks query MESSAGE IDs, and the MESSAGE ID
matches the MESSAGE ID of a query it received for which a response has not yet been sent,
it MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.   This behavior is required to prevent
a hypothetical attack that takes advantage of undefined behavior in this case.   However,
if the server does not track MESSAGE IDs in this way, no such risk exists, so tracking
MESSAGE IDs just to implement this sanity check is not required.</t>

<section anchor="error-responses" title="Error Responses">

<t>When an unacknowledged DSO message type is received (MESSAGE ID field is zero), the receiver SHOULD already be expecting this DSO message type.
<xref target="unrecognized"/> describes the handling of unknown DSO message types. Parsing
errors MUST also result in the receiver aborting the connection.
When an unacknowledged DSO
message of an unexpected type is received, the receiver should abort the connection.
Other internal errors processing the unacknowledged DSO message are
implementation dependent as to whether the connection should be aborted
according to the severity of the error.</t>

<t>When an acknowledged DSO request message is unsuccessful for some reason,
the responder returns an error code to the initiator.</t>

<t>In the case of a server returning an error code to a client
in response to an unsuccessful DSO request message, the server MAY choose
to end the DSO Session, or MAY choose to allow the DSO Session to remain open.
For error conditions that only affect the single operation in question, the server SHOULD
return an error response to the client and leave the DSO Session open for further operations.</t>

<t>For error conditions that are likely to make all operations unsuccessful in the
immediate future, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and then
end the DSO Session by sending a Retry Delay message, as described in <xref target="retry"/>.</t>

<t>Upon receiving an error response from the server, a client SHOULD NOT
automatically close the DSO Session. An error relating to one particular operation
on a DSO Session does not necessarily imply that all other operations on that
DSO Session have also failed, or that future operations will fail. The client
should assume that the server will make its own decision about whether or not to
end the DSO Session, based on the server’s determination of whether the error
condition pertains to this particular operation, or would also apply to any
subsequent operations. If the server does not end the DSO Session by
sending the client a Retry Delay message (<xref target="retry"/>) then the client
SHOULD continue to use that DSO Session for subsequent operations.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="flow-control-considerations" title="Flow Control Considerations">

<t>Because unacknowledged DSO messages do not generate an immediate response from the responder, if
there is no other traffic flowing from the responder to the initiator, this can result in a
200ms delay before the TCP acknowledgment is sent to the initiator <xref target="NagleDA"/>.  If the
initiator has another message pending, but has not yet filled its output buffer, this can delay
the delivery of that message by more than 200ms.  In many cases, this will make no difference.
However, implementors should be aware of this issue.  Some operating systems offer ways to
disable the 200ms TCP acknowledgment delay; this may be useful for relatively low-traffic
sessions, or sessions with bursty traffic flows.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cancellation" title="Responder-Initiated Operation Cancellation">

<t>This document, the base specification for DNS Stateful Operations,
does not itself define any long-lived operations,
but it defines a framework for supporting long-lived operations,
such as Push Notification subscriptions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> and
Discovery Relay interface subscriptions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>.</t>

<t>Generally speaking, a long-lived operation is initiated by the initiator,
and, if successful, remains active until the initiator terminates the operation.</t>

<t>However, it is possible that a long-lived operation may be valid
at the time it was initiated, but then a later change of circumstances
may render that previously valid operation invalid.</t>

<t>For example, a long-lived client operation may pertain to a name
that the server is authoritative for, but then the server configuration
is changed such that it is no longer authoritative for that name.</t>

<t>In such cases, instead of terminating the entire session
it may be desirable for the responder to be able to cancel
selectively only those operations that have become invalid.</t>

<t>The responder performs this selective cancellation by sending
a new response message, with the MESSAGE ID field containing the
MESSAGE ID of the long-lived operation that is to be terminated
(that it had previously acknowledged with a NOERROR RCODE), and the
RCODE field of the new response message giving the reason for cancellation.</t>

<t>After a response message with nonzero RCODE has been sent,
that operation has been terminated from the responder’s point of view,
and the responder sends no more messages relating to that operation.</t>

<t>After a response message with nonzero RCODE has been received by the initiator,
that operation has been terminated from the initiator’s point of view,
and the cancelled operation’s MESSAGE ID is now free for reuse.</t>

<section anchor="lifecycle" title="DSO Session Lifecycle and Timers">

<section anchor="dso-session-initiation" title="DSO Session Initiation">

<t>A DSO Session begins as described in <xref target="establishment"/>.</t>

<t>The client may perform as many DNS operations as it wishes using the
newly created DSO Session. When the
client has multiple messages to send, it SHOULD NOT wait for each response before sending the next message.
This prevents TCP’s delayed acknowledgement algorithm from forcing the
client into a slow lock-step.
The server MUST act on messages in the order they are transmitted, but
when responses to those messages become available out of order, the server
SHOULD NOT delay sending available responses to respond in order.
<xref target="RFC7766"/> section 3.3 specifies this in more detail.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sessiontimeouts" title="DSO Session Timeouts">

<t>Two timeout values are associated with a DSO Session:
the inactivity timeout, and the keepalive interval. 
Both values are communicated in the same TLV, the Keepalive TLV (<xref target="keepalive"/>).</t>

<t>The first timeout value, the inactivity timeout, is the maximum time for which
a client may speculatively keep a DSO Session open with no operations pending
(e.g., an outstanding DNS Push request)
in the expectation that
it may have future requests to send to that server.</t>

<t>The second timeout value, the keepalive interval, is the maximum permitted
interval between messages if the client wishes to keep the DSO Session alive.</t>

<t>The two timeout values are independent. The inactivity timeout may be lower,
the same, or higher than the keepalive interval, though in most cases the
inactivity timeout is expected to be shorter than the keepalive interval.</t>

<t>A shorter inactivity timeout with a longer keepalive interval signals
to the client that it should not speculatively keep an inactive DSO
Session open for very long without reason, but when it does have an
active reason to keep a DSO Session open, it doesn’t need to be sending
an aggressive level of DSO keepalive traffic to maintain that session.
An example of this would be a client that has subscribed to DNS Push
notifications: in this case, the client is not sending any traffic to the
server, but the session is not inactive, because there is a pending request
to the server to receive push notifications.</t>

<t>A longer inactivity timeout with a shorter keepalive interval
signals to the client that it may speculatively keep an inactive
DSO Session open for a long time, but to maintain that inactive
DSO Session it should be sending a lot of DSO keepalive traffic.
This configuration is expected to be less common.</t>

<t>In the usual case where the inactivity timeout is shorter than the keepalive
interval, it is only when a client has a very long-lived, low-traffic, operation
that the keepalive interval comes into play, to ensure that a sufficient
residual amount of traffic is generated to maintain NAT and firewall state
and to assure client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</t>

<t>On a new DSO Session, if no explicit DSO Keepalive message exchange has taken 
place, the default value for both timeouts is 15 seconds.</t>

<t>For both timeouts, lower values of the timeout result in higher network traffic
and higher CPU load on the server.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inactive-dso-sessions" title="Inactive DSO Sessions">

<t>At both servers and clients, the generation or reception of any complete
DNS message, including DNS requests, responses, updates, or DSO
messages, resets both timers for that DSO Session, with the exception
that a DSO Keepalive message resets only the keepalive timer,
not the inactivity timeout timer.</t>

<t>In addition, for as long as the client has an outstanding operation in progress,
the inactivity timer remains cleared, and an inactivity timeout cannot occur.</t>

<t>For short-lived DNS operations like traditional queries and updates,
an operation is considered in progress for the time between request and 
response, typically a period of a few hundred milliseconds at most.
At the client, the inactivity timer is cleared upon transmission of a 
request and remains cleared until reception of the corresponding response.
At the server, the inactivity timer is cleared upon reception of a request
and remains cleared until transmission of the corresponding response.</t>

<t>For long-lived DNS Stateful operations (such as
a Push Notification subscription <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> or
a Discovery Relay interface subscription <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>),
an operation is considered in progress
for as long as the operation is active, until it is cancelled.
This means that a DSO Session can exist, with active operations,
with no messages flowing in either direction, for far longer than the 
inactivity timeout, and this is not an error.
This is why there are two separate timers:
the inactivity timeout, and the keepalive interval.
Just because a DSO Session has no traffic for an extended period of time
does not automatically make that DSO Session “inactive”,
if it has an active operation that is awaiting events.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

</section>
<section anchor="inactivetimer" title="The Inactivity Timeout">

<t>The purpose of the inactivity timeout is for the server to balance its trade off 
between the costs of setting up new DSO Sessions and the costs of maintaining inactive 
DSO Sessions. A server with abundant DSO Session capacity can offer a high inactivity timeout, 
to permit clients to keep a speculative DSO Session open for a long time, to save 
the cost of establishing a new DSO Session for future communications with that 
server. A server with scarce memory resources can offer a low inactivity timeout,
to cause clients to promptly close DSO Sessions whenever they have no outstanding
operations with that server, and then create a new DSO Session later when needed.</t>

<section anchor="closing-inactive-dso-sessions" title="Closing Inactive DSO Sessions">

<t>When a connection’s inactivity timeout is reached the client MUST
begin closing the idle connection, but a client is not required to
keep an idle connection open until the inactivity timeout is reached.
A client MAY close a DSO Session at any time, at the client’s discretion.
If a client determines that it has no current or reasonably
anticipated future need for a currently inactive DSO Session,
then the client SHOULD gracefully close that connection.</t>

<t>If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session,
the inactivity timeout value (i.e., 15 seconds by default) elapses
without there being any operation active on the DSO Session,
the client MUST close the connection gracefully.</t>

<t>If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session,
twice the inactivity timeout value (i.e., 30 seconds by default),
or five seconds, if twice the inactivity timeout value is less than five seconds,
elapses without there being any operation active on the DSO Session,
the server MUST consider the client delinquent,
and MUST forcibly abort the DSO Session.</t>

<t>In this context, an operation being active on a DSO Session includes
a query waiting for a response, an update waiting for a response,
or an active long-lived operation, but not a DSO Keepalive message exchange itself.
A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive
interval timer, not the inactivity timeout timer.</t>

<t>If the client wishes to keep an inactive DSO Session open for longer
than the default duration then it uses the DSO Keepalive message
to request longer timeout values, as described in <xref target="keepalive"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="values-for-the-inactivity-timeout" title="Values for the Inactivity Timeout">

<t>For the inactivity timeout value, lower values result in
more frequent DSO Session teardown and re-establishment.
Higher values result in lower traffic and lower CPU load on the server,
but higher memory burden to maintain state for inactive DSO Sessions.</t>

<t>A server may dictate any value it chooses for the inactivity timeout
(either in a response to a client-initiated request, or in a server-initiated message)
including values under one second, or even zero.</t>

<t>An inactivity timeout of zero informs the client that it
should not speculatively maintain idle connections at all, and
as soon as the client has completed the operation or operations relating
to this server, the client should immediately begin closing this session.</t>

<t>A server will abort an idle client session after twice the
inactivity timeout value, or five seconds, whichever is greater.
In the case of a zero inactivity timeout value, this means that
if a client fails to close an idle client session then the server
will forcibly abort the idle session after five seconds.</t>

<t>An inactivity timeout of 0xFFFFFFFF represents “infinity” and
informs the client that it may keep an idle connection open as long as it wishes.
Note that after granting an unlimited inactivity timeout in this way,
at any point the server may revise that inactivity timeout by sending
a new DSO Keepalive message dictating new Session Timeout values to the client.</t>

<t>The largest <spanx style="strong">finite</spanx> inactivity timeout
supported by the current Keepalive TLV is
0xFFFFFFFE (2^32-2 milliseconds, approximately 49.7 days).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="keepalivetimer" title="The Keepalive Interval">

<t>The purpose of the keepalive interval is to manage the generation of
sufficient messages to maintain state in middleboxes (such at NAT gateways
or firewalls) and for the client and server to periodically verify that they
still have connectivity to each other. This allows them to clean up state
when connectivity is lost, and to establish a new session if appropriate.</t>

<section anchor="keepalive-interval-expiry" title="Keepalive Interval Expiry">

<t>If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session,
the keepalive interval value (i.e., 15 seconds by default) elapses
without any DNS messages being sent or received on a DSO Session,
the client MUST take action to keep the DSO Session alive,
by sending a DSO Keepalive message (<xref target="keepalive"/>).
A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive timer, 
not the inactivity timer.</t>

<t>If a client disconnects from the network abruptly,
without cleanly closing its DSO Session,
perhaps leaving a long-lived operation uncancelled,
the server learns of this after failing to
receive the required DSO keepalive traffic from that client.
If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session,
twice the keepalive interval value (i.e., 30 seconds by default) elapses
without any DNS messages being sent or received on a DSO Session,
the server SHOULD consider the client delinquent,
and SHOULD forcibly abort the DSO Session.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="values-for-the-keepalive-interval" title="Values for the Keepalive Interval">

<t>For the keepalive interval value, lower values result in a higher volume of DSO keepalive 
traffic. Higher values of the keepalive interval reduce traffic and CPU load, 
but have minimal effect on the memory burden
at the server, because clients keep a DSO Session open for the same length of time
(determined by the inactivity timeout) regardless of the level of DSO keepalive traffic 
required.</t>

<t>It may be appropriate for clients and servers to select different keepalive 
interval values depending on the nature of the network they are on.</t>

<t>A corporate DNS server that knows it is serving only clients on the internal 
network, with no intervening NAT gateways or firewalls, can impose a higher 
keepalive interval, because frequent DSO keepalive traffic is not required.</t>

<t>A public DNS server that is serving primarily residential consumer clients, 
where it is likely there will be a NAT gateway on the path, may impose a lower 
keepalive interval, to generate more frequent DSO keepalive traffic.</t>

<t>A smart client may be adaptive to its environment. A client using
a private IPv4 address <xref target="RFC1918"/> to communicate with a DNS server
at an address outside that IPv4 private address block,
may conclude that there is likely to be a NAT gateway on the path,
and accordingly request a lower keepalive interval.</t>

<t>By default it is RECOMMENDED that clients request,
and servers grant, a keepalive interval of 60 minutes.
This keepalive interval provides for reasonably timely detection if
a client abruptly disconnects without cleanly closing the session,
and is sufficient to maintain state in firewalls and NAT gateways
that follow the IETF recommended Best Current Practice that the
“established connection idle-timeout” used by middleboxes
be at least 2 hours 4 minutes <xref target="RFC5382"/> <xref target="RFC7857"/>.</t>

<t>Note that the lower the keepalive interval value, the higher the load on client
and server. For example, a hypothetical keepalive interval value of 100ms would result
in a continuous stream of at least ten messages per second, in both directions,
to keep the DSO Session alive. And, in this extreme example, a single packet loss and
retransmission over a long path could introduce a momentary pause in the stream of messages,
long enough to cause the server to overzealously abort the connection.</t>

<t>Because of this concern, the server MUST NOT send a DSO Keepalive message
(either a response to a client-initiated request, or a server-initiated message)
with a keepalive interval value less than ten seconds.
If a client receives a DSO Keepalive message specifying a keepalive interval value
less than ten seconds this is a fatal error and the client MUST
forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>A keepalive interval value of 0xFFFFFFFF represents “infinity” and
informs the client that it should generate no DSO keepalive traffic.
Note that after signaling that the client should generate no DSO keepalive traffic in this way,
at any point the server may revise that DSO keepalive traffic requirement by sending
a new DSO Keepalive message dictating new Session Timeout values to the client.</t>

<t>The largest <spanx style="strong">finite</spanx> keepalive interval

</section>
<section anchor="server-initiated-session-termination" title="Server-Initiated Session Termination">

<t>In addition to cancelling individual long-lived operations selectively (<xref target="cancellation"/>)
there are also occasions where a server may need to terminate one or more entire sessions.
An entire session may need to be terminated if the client is defective in some way,
or departs from the network without closing its session.
Sessions may also need to be terminated if the server becomes overloaded,
or if the server is reconfigured and lacks the ability to be selective about
which operations need to be cancelled.</t>

<t>This section discusses various reasons a session may be terminated,
and the mechanisms for doing so.</t>

<t>In normal operation, closing a DSO Session is the client’s responsibility.
The client makes the determination of when to close a DSO
Session based on an evaluation of both its own needs,
and the inactivity timeout value dictated by the server.
A server only causes a DSO Session to be ended in the exceptional circumstances outlined below.</t>

<t>Some of the exceptional situations in which a server may terminate a DSO Session include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The server application software or underlying operating system
is shutting down or restarting.</t>
  <t>The server application software terminates unexpectedly
(perhaps due to a bug that makes it crash).</t>
  <t>The server is undergoing a reconfiguration or maintenance
procedure, that, due to the way the server software is
implemented, requires clients to be disconnected.
For example, some software is implemented such that it reads
a configuration file at startup, and changing the server’s
configuration entails modifying the configuration file
and then killing and restarting the server software,
which generally entails a loss of network connections.</t>
  <t>The client fails to meets its obligation to generate the required
DSO keepalive traffic, or to close an inactive session by the prescribed time
(twice the time interval dictated by the server, or five seconds,
whichever is greater, as described in <xref target="sessiontimeouts"/>).</t>
  <t>The client sends a grossly invalid or malformed request that
is indicative of a seriously defective client implementation.</t>
  <t>The server is over capacity and needs to shed some load.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="retry" title="Server-Initiated Retry Delay Message">

<t>In the cases described above where a server elects to terminate a
DSO Session, it could do so simply by forcibly aborting the connection.
However, if it did this the likely behavior of the client might be simply to to treat
this as a network failure and reconnect immediately, putting more burden on the server.</t>

<t>Therefore, to avoid this reconnection implosion, a server SHOULD instead choose
to shed client load by sending a Retry Delay message, with an appropriate RCODE
value informing the client of the reason the DSO Session needs to be terminated.
The format of the Retry Delay TLV, and the interpretations of the various RCODE values,
are described in <xref target="delay"/>.
After sending a Retry Delay message,
the server MUST NOT send any further messages on that DSO Session.</t>

<t>The server MAY randomize retry delays in situations where many retry delays are sent
in quick succession, so as to avoid all the clients attempting to reconnect at once.
In general, implementations should avoid using the Retry Delay message in a way that
would result in many clients reconnecting at the same time, if every client attempts
to reconnect at the exact time specified.</t>

<t>Upon receipt of a Retry Delay message from the server,
the client MUST make note of the reconnect delay for this server,
and then immediately close the connection gracefully.</t>

<t>After sending a Retry Delay message the server SHOULD allow the
client five seconds to close the connection, and if the client has not
closed the connection after five seconds then the server SHOULD
forcibly abort the connection.</t>

<t>A Retry Delay message MUST NOT be initiated by a client.
If a server receives a Retry Delay message this is a fatal error
and the server MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

<section anchor="outstanding-operations" title="Outstanding Operations">

<t>At the instant a server chooses to initiate a Retry Delay message
there may be DNS requests already in flight from client to server on this 
DSO Session, which will arrive at the server after its Retry Delay message 
has been sent.
The server MUST silently ignore such incoming requests, and MUST NOT generate
any response messages for them. When the Retry Delay message from the
server arrives at the client, the client will determine that any DNS requests
it previously sent on this DSO Session, that have not yet received a response, now 
will certainly not be receiving any response. Such requests should be considered
failed, and should be retried at a later time, as appropriate.</t>

<t>In the case where some, but not all, of the existing operations on a DSO Session 
have become invalid (perhaps because the server has been reconfigured and is no 
longer authoritative for some of the names),
but the server is terminating all affected DSO Sessions en masse
by sending them all a Retry Delay message,
the reconnect delay MAY be zero, indicating that the clients SHOULD immediately
attempt to re-establish operations.</t>

<t>It is likely that some of the attempts will be successful and some will not,
depending on the nature of the reconfiguration.</t>

<t>In the case where a server is terminating a large number of DSO Sessions at once
(e.g., if the system is restarting) and the server doesn’t want to be inundated 
with a flood of simultaneous retries, it SHOULD send different reconnect delay 
values to each client.
These adjustments MAY be selected randomly, pseudorandomly, or deterministically
(e.g., incrementing the time value by one tenth of a second for each successive
client, yielding a post-restart reconnection rate of ten clients per second).</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

</section>
<section anchor="client-reconnection" title="Client Reconnection">

<t>After a DSO Session is ended by the server
(either by sending the client a Retry Delay message,
or by forcibly aborting the underlying transport connection)
the client SHOULD try to reconnect,
to that service instance, or to another suitable service instance, if more than one is available.
If reconnecting to the same service instance, the client MUST respect the indicated delay,
if available, before attempting to reconnect.   Clients should not attempt to randomize the delay;
the server will randomly jitter the retry delay values it sends to each client if this behavior is
desired.</t>

<t>If the service instance will only be out of service for a short maintenance period,
it should use a value a little longer that the expected maintenance window.
It should not default to a very large delay value, or clients may
not attempt to reconnect after it resumes service.</t>

<t>If a particular service instance does not want a client to reconnect ever
(perhaps the service instance is being de-commissioned),
it SHOULD set the retry delay to the maximum value
0xFFFFFFFF (2^32-1 milliseconds, approximately 49.7 days).
It is not possible to instruct a client to stay away for longer than 49.7 days.
If, after 49.7 days, the DNS or other configuration information
still indicates that this is the valid service instance for a
particular service, then clients MAY attempt to reconnect.
In reality, if a client is rebooted or otherwise lose state, it
may well attempt to reconnect before 49.7 days elapses, for as
long as the DNS or other configuration information continues to
indicate that this is the service instance the client should use.</t>

<t>The Keepalive TLV (DSO-TYPE=1) performs two functions:
to reset the keepalive timer for the DSO Session,

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='INACTIVITY TIMEOUT:'>
  The inactivity timeout for the current DSO Session, specified as
a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network (big endian) byte order, in units of milliseconds.
This is the timeout at which the client MUST begin closing an inactive DSO Session.
The inactivity timeout can be any value of the server’s choosing.
If the client does not gracefully close an inactive DSO
Session, then after twice this interval, or five seconds,
whichever is greater, the server will forcibly abort the connection.</t>
  <t hangText='KEEPALIVE INTERVAL:'>
  The keepalive interval for the current DSO Session, specified as
a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network (big endian) byte order, in units of milliseconds.
This is the interval at which a client MUST generate DSO keepalive
traffic to maintain connection state.
The keepalive interval MUST NOT be less than ten seconds.
If the client does not generate the mandated DSO keepalive traffic,
then after twice this interval the server will forcibly abort the connection.
Since the minimum allowed keepalive interval is ten seconds, the
minimum time at which a server will forcibly disconnect a client for
failing to generate the mandated DSO keepalive traffic is twenty seconds.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The transmission or reception of DSO Keepalive messages
(i.e., messages where the Keepalive TLV is the first TLV)
reset only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer.
The reason for this is that periodic DSO Keepalive messages are sent for the sole
purpose of keeping a DSO Session alive, when that DSO Session has current
or recent non-maintenance activity that warrants keeping that DSO Session alive.
Sending DSO keepalive traffic itself is not considered a client activity;
it is considered a maintenance activity that is performed
in service of other client activities.
If DSO keepalive traffic itself were to reset the inactivity timer,
then that would create a circular livelock where keepalive traffic
would be sent indefinitely to keep a DSO Session alive, where the only
activity on that DSO Session would be the keepalive traffic keeping
the DSO Session alive so that further keepalive traffic can be sent.
For a DSO Session to be considered active, it must be carrying
something more than just keepalive traffic.
This is why merely sending or receiving a DSO Keepalive message
does not reset the inactivity timer.</t>

<t>When sent by a client, the DSO Keepalive request message MUST
be sent as an acknowledged request, with a nonzero MESSAGE ID.
If a server receives a DSO Keepalive message with a zero MESSAGE ID then
this is a fatal error and the server MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.
The DSO Keepalive request message resets a DSO Session’s keepalive timer,
and at the same time communicates to the server the the client’s
requested Session Timeout values.
In a server response to a client-initiated DSO Keepalive request message,
the Session Timeouts contain the server’s chosen values from
this point forward in the DSO Session, which the client MUST respect.
This is modeled after the DHCP protocol, where the client requests a certain
lease lifetime using DHCP option 51 <xref target="RFC2132"/>, but the server is the
ultimate authority for deciding what lease lifetime is actually granted.</t>

<t>When a client is sending its second and subsequent DSO Keepalive requests to
the server, the client SHOULD continue to request its preferred values each time.
This allows flexibility, so that if conditions change during the lifetime of a
DSO Session, the server can adapt its responses to better fit the client’s needs.</t>

<t>Once a DSO Session is in progress (<xref target="establishment"/>)
a DSO Keepalive message MAY be initiated by a server.
When sent by a server, the DSO Keepalive message MUST be
sent as an unacknowledged message, with the MESSAGE ID set to zero.
The client MUST NOT generate a response to a server-initiated DSO Keepalive message.
If a client receives a DSO Keepalive request message with a nonzero MESSAGE ID then
this is a fatal error and the client MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.
The unacknowledged DSO Keepalive message from the server resets a DSO Session’s keepalive timer,
and at the same time unilaterally informs the client of the new
Session Timeout values to use from this point forward in this DSO Session.
No client DSO response message to this unilateral declaration is required or allowed.</t>

<t>In DSO Keepalive response messages, the Keepalive TLV is REQUIRED and is used only 
as a Response Primary TLV sent as a reply to a DSO Keepalive request message from 
the client.
A Keepalive TLV MUST NOT be added to other responses as a Response Additional TLV.
If the server wishes to update a client’s Session Timeout values
other than in response to a DSO Keepalive request message from the client,
then it does so by sending an unacknowledged DSO Keepalive message
of its own, as described above.</t>

<t>It is not required that the Keepalive TLV be used in every DSO Session.
While many DNS Stateful operations
will be used in conjunction with a long-lived session state,
not all DNS Stateful operations require long-lived session state,
and in some cases the default 15-second value for both the inactivity timeout
and keepalive interval may be perfectly appropriate.
However, note that for clients that implement only the DSO-TYPEs defined in this document,
a Keepalive request message is the only way for a client to initiate a DSO Session.</t>

<section anchor="client-handling-of-received-session-timeout-values" title="Client handling of received Session Timeout values">

<t>When a client receives a response to its client-initiated DSO Keepalive message,
or receives a server-initiated DSO Keepalive message, the client has then 
received Session Timeout values dictated by the server. The two timeout values 
contained in the Keepalive TLV from the server may each be higher, lower, or 
the same as the respective Session Timeout values the client previously had for 
this DSO Session.</t>

<t>In the case of the keepalive timer, the handling of the received value is straightforward. When
a client receives a server-initiated message with the Keepalive TLV as its primary TLV, it resets the
keepalive timer.  Whenever it receives a Keepalive TLV from the server, either in a server-initiated
message or a reply to its own client-initiated Keepalive message, it updates the keepalive interval
for the DSO Session. The new keepalive
interval indicates the maximum time that may elapse before another message must be sent or
received on this DSO Session, if the DSO Session is to remain alive.
If the client receives a response to a keepalive message that specifies a keepalive interval
shorter than the current keepalive timer, the client MUST immediately send a Keepalive message.
However, this should not normally happen in practice: it would require that Keepalive interval
the server be shorter than the round-trip time of the connection.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines='999' /></t>

<t>In the case of the inactivity timeout, the handling of the received
value is a little more subtle, though the meaning of the inactivity
timeout remains as specified — it still indicates the maximum
permissible time allowed without useful activity on a DSO Session.
The act of receiving the message containing the Keepalive TLV does not
itself reset the inactivity timer. The time elapsed since the last useful
activity on this DSO Session is unaffected by exchange of DSO Keepalive messages.
The new inactivity timeout value in the Keepalive TLV in the received message
does update the timeout associated with the running inactivity timer;
that becomes the new maximum permissible time without activity on a DSO Session.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If the current inactivity timer value is less than the
new inactivity timeout, then the DSO Session may remain open for now.
When the inactivity timer value reaches the new inactivity timeout,
the client MUST then begin closing the DSO Session, as described above.</t>
  <t>If the current inactivity timer value is equal to the
new inactivity timeout, then this DSO Session has been
inactive for exactly as long as the server will permit,
and now the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.</t>
  <t>If the current inactivity timer value is already greater
than the new inactivity timeout, then this DSO Session has
already been inactive for longer than the server permits,
and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.</t>
  <t>If the current inactivity timer value is already more than twice the
new inactivity timeout, then the client is immediately considered delinquent
(this DSO Session is immediately eligible to be forcibly terminated by the server)
and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.
However if a server abruptly reduces the inactivity timeout in this
way, then, to give the client time to close the connection gracefully
before the server resorts to forcibly aborting it, the server
SHOULD give the client an additional grace period of one quarter
of the new inactivity timeout, or five seconds, whichever is greater.</t>

<t>The inactivity timeout value in the Keepalive TLV (DSO-TYPE=1) has

client/server pair that supports DSO MUST NOT use the edns-tcp-keepalive
EDNS0 Option within any message after a DSO Session has been
established. A client that has sent a DSO message to establish a
session MUST NOT send an edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option from this
point on. Once a DSO Session has been established, if either client
or server receives a DNS message over the DSO Session that contains
an edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option, this is a fatal error and the

<section anchor="retry-delay-tlv-used-as-a-primary-tlv" title="Retry Delay TLV used as a Primary TLV">

<t>When sent from server to client, the
Retry Delay TLV is used as the Primary TLV in an unacknowledged message.
It is used by a server
to instruct a client to close the DSO Session and underlying connection,
and not to reconnect for the indicated time interval.</t>

<t>In this case it applies to the DSO Session as a whole, and the client MUST begin closing the 
DSO Session, as described in <xref target="retry"/>. The RCODE in the message header 
SHOULD indicate the principal reason for the termination:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>NOERROR indicates a routine shutdown or restart.</t>
  <t>FORMERR indicates that the client requests are too badly malformed for the session to continue.</t>
  <t>SERVFAIL indicates that the server is overloaded due to resource exhaustion and needs to shed load.</t>
  <t>REFUSED indicates that the server has been reconfigured,
and at this time it is now unable to perform one or more
of the long-lived client operations that were previously being performed on this DSO Session.</t>
  <t>NOTAUTH indicates that the server has been reconfigured
and at this time it is now unable to perform one or more
of the long-lived client operations that were previously being performed on this DSO Session
because it does not have authority over the names in question
(for example, a DNS Push Notification server could be reconfigured
such that is is no longer accepting DNS Push Notification
requests for one or more of the currently subscribed names).</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document specifies only these RCODE values for Retry Delay message.
Servers sending Retry Delay messages SHOULD use one of these values.
However, future circumstances may create situations where other RCODE values
are appropriate in Retry Delay messages, so clients MUST be prepared
to accept Retry Delay messages with any RCODE value.</t>

<t>In some cases, when a server sends a Retry Delay message to a client,
there may be more than one reason for the server wanting to end the session.
Possibly the configuration could have been changed such that some
long-lived client operations can no longer be continued due to policy (REFUSED), and other
long-lived client operations can no longer be performed due to
the server no longer being authoritative for those names (NOTAUTH).
In such cases the server MAY use any of the applicable RCODE values,
or RCODE=NOERROR (routine shutdown or restart).</t>

<t>Note that the selection of RCODE value in a Retry Delay message
is not critical, since the RCODE value is generally used only for
information purposes, such as writing to a log file for future
human analysis regarding the nature of the disconnection.
Generally clients do not modify their behavior depending on the RCODE value.
The RETRY DELAY in the message tells the client how long it should
wait before attempting a new connection to this service instance.</t>

<t>For clients that do in some way modify their behavior depending on the RCODE value,
they should treat unknown RCODE values the same as RCODE=NOERROR (routine shutdown or restart).</t>

<t>A Retry Delay message from server to client is an unacknowledged message;
the MESSAGE ID MUST be set to zero in the outgoing message
and the client MUST NOT send a response.</t>

<t>A client MUST NOT send a Retry Delay DSO message to a server.
If a server receives a DSO message where the Primary TLV is the Retry Delay TLV,
this is a fatal error and the server MUST forcibly abort the connection immediately.</t>

<t>If this mechanism is to be used with DNS over TLS, then these messages
are subject to the same constraints as any other DNS-over-TLS messages
and MUST NOT be sent in the clear before the TLS session is established.</t>

<t>The data field of the “Encryption Padding” TLV could be used as a covert channel.</t>

<t>When designing new DSO TLVs, the potential for data in the
TLV to be used as a tracking identifier should be taken
into consideration, and should be avoided when not required.</t>

<t>When used without TLS or similar cryptographic protection, a malicious
entity maybe able to inject a malicious Retry Delay Unacknowledged Message
into the data stream, specifying an unreasonably large RETRY DELAY, causing
a denial-of-service attack against the client.</t>

<t>The establishment of DSO sessions has an increasing impact on the number of
open TCP connections on a DNS server. Additional resources may be used on the
server as a result. However, because the server can limit the number of DSO
sessions established and can also close existing DSO sessions as needed, denial
of service or resource exhaustion should not be a concern.</t>

<section anchor="tcp-fast-open-considerations" title="TCP Fast Open Considerations">

<t>It would be possible to add a TLV that requires the server to do some significant
work, and send that to the server as initial data in a TCP SYN packet.   A flood
of such packets could be used as a DoS attack on the server.   None of the TLVs
defined here have this property.   If a new TLV is specified that does have this
property, the specification should require that some kind of exchange be done with
the server before work is done.   That is, the TLV that requires work could not
be processed without a round-trip from the server to the client to verify that
the source address of the packet is reachable.</t>

<t>One way to accomplish this would be to have the client send a TLV indicating that
it wishes to have the server do work of this sort; this TLV would not actually result
in work being done, but would request a nonce from the server.   The client could
then use that nonce to request that work be done.</t>

<t>Alternatively, the server could simply disable TCP fast open.   This same problem
would exist for DNS-over-TLS with TLS early data; the same remedies would apply.</t>
