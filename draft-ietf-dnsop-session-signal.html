  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The use of transports for DNS other than UDP is being increasingly specified, for example, DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a><a href="#RFC7766">[RFC7766]</a> and DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858">[RFC7858]</a>.  Such transports can offer persistent, long-lived sessions and therefore when using them for transporting DNS messages it is of benefit to have a mechanism that can establish parameters associated with those sessions, such as timeouts.  In such situations it is also advantageous to support server initiated messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The existing EDNS(0) Extension Mechanism for DNS <a href="#RFC6891">[RFC6891]</a> is explicitly defined to only have &#8220;per-message&#8221; semantics. Whilst EDNS(0) has been used to signal at least one session-related parameter (the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option <a href="#RFC7828">[RFC7828]</a>) the result is less than optimal due to the restrictions imposed by the EDNS(0) semantics and the lack of server-initiated signalling.  For example, a server cannot arbitrarily instruct a client to close a connection because the server can only send EDNS(0) options in responses to queries that contained EDNS(0) options.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document defines a new DNS OPCODE, for DNS Stateful Operations (DSO).  DSO messages are used to communicate operations within persistent stateful sessions, expressed using type-length-value (TLV) syntax.  This document defines an initial set of TLVs, including ones used to manage session timeouts and termination.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">All three of the TLVs defined here are mandatory for all implementations of DSO.  Additional TLVs may be defined in additional specifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">It should be noted that the message format for DNS Stateful Operations (see <a href="#format">Section 4.2</a>) differs from the traditional DNS packet format used for standard queries and responses.  The standard twelve-octet header is used, but the four count fields (QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) are set to zero and their corresponding sections are not present.  The actual data pertaining to DNS Stateful Operations (expressed in TLV format) is appended to the end of the DNS message header.  When displayed using packet analyzer tools that have not been updated to recognize the DNS Stateful Operations format, this will result in the Stateful Operations data being displayed as unknown additional data after the end of the DNS message.  It is likely that future updates to these tools will add the ability to recognize, decode, and display the Stateful Operations data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">This new format has distinct advantages over an RR-based format because it is more explicit and more compact. Each TLV definition is specific to the use case, and as a result contains no redundant or overloaded fields.  Importantly, it completely avoids conflating DNS Stateful Operations in anyway with normal DNS operations or with existing EDNS(0) based functionality.  A goal of this approach is to avoid the operational issues that have befallen EDNS(0), particularly relating to middle-box behaviour.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">With EDNS(0), multiple options may be packed into a single OPT pseudo-RR, and there is no generalized mechanism for a client to be able to tell whether a server has processed or otherwise acted upon each individual option within the combined OPT RR.  The specifications for each individual option need to define how each different option is to be acknowledged, if necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">In contrast to EDNS(0), with DNS Stateful Operations there is no compelling motivation to pack multiple operations into a single message for efficiency reasons, because DNS Stateful Operations always operates using a connection-oriented transport protocol.  Each Stateful operation is communicated in its own separate DNS message, and the transport protocol can take care of packing separate DNS messages into a single IP packet if appropriate.  For example, TCP can pack multiple small DNS messages into a single TCP segment.  This simplification allows for clearer semantics.  Each DSO request message communicates just one primary operation, and the RCODE in the corresponding response message indicates the success or failure of that operation.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words &#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;REQUIRED&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL NOT&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD NOT&#8221;, &#8220;RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;NOT RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;MAY&#8221;, and &#8220;OPTIONAL&#8221; in this document are to be interpreted as described in &#8220;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&#8221; <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">&#8220;DSO&#8221; is used to mean DNS Stateful Operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The term &#8220;connection&#8221; means a bidirectional byte stream of reliable, in-order messages, such as provided by using DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a><a href="#RFC7766">[RFC7766]</a> or DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858">[RFC7858]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">The unqualified term &#8220;session&#8221; in the context of this document means the exchange of DNS messages over a connection where:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The connection between client and server is persistent and relatively long-lived (i.e., minutes or hours, rather than seconds).</li>
  <li>Either end of the connection may initiate messages to the other.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">A &#8220;DSO Session&#8221; is established between two endpoints that acknowledge persistent DNS state via the exchange of DSO messages over the connection. This is distinct from, for example a DNS-over-TCP session as described in RC7766.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">A &#8220;DSO Session&#8221; is terminated when the underlying connection is closed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">The term &#8220;server&#8221; means the software with a listening socket, awaiting incoming connection requests.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">The term &#8220;client&#8221; means the software which initiates a connection to the server&#8217;s listening socket.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.10">The terms &#8220;initiator&#8221; and &#8220;responder&#8221; correspond respectively to the initial sender and subsequent receiver of a DSO request message, regardless of which was the &#8220;client&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221; in the usual DNS sense.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.11">The term &#8220;sender&#8221; may apply to either an initiator (when sending a DNS Stateful Operation request message) or a responder (when sending a DNS Stateful Operation response message).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.12">Likewise, the term &#8220;receiver&#8221; may apply to either a responder (when receiving a DNS Stateful Operation request message) or an initiator (when receiving a DNS Stateful Operation response message).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.13">DNS Stateful Operations are expressed using type-length-value (TLV) syntax.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.14">Two timers (elapsed time since an event) are defined in this document:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>an inactivity timer (see <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a> and <a href="#inactivetimer">Section 5.3</a>)</li>
  <li>a keepalive timer (see <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a> and <a href="#keepalivetimer">Section 5.5</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.16">The timeouts associated with these timers are called the inactivity timeout and the keepalive interval respectively.  The term &#8220;Session Timeouts&#8221; is used to refer to this pair of timeout values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.17">Reseting a timer means resetting the timer value to zero and starting the timer again. Clearing a timer means resetting the timer value to zero but NOT starting the time again.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#discussion" id="discussion">Discussion</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">There are several use cases for DNS Stateful operations that can be described here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">Firstly, establishing session parameters such as server defined timeouts is of great use in the general management of persistent connections. For example, using DSO sessions for stub to recursive DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858">[RFC7858]</a> is more flexible for both the client and the server than attempting to manage sessions using just the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option <a href="#RFC7828">[RFC7828]</a>. The simple set of TLVs defined in this document is sufficient to greatly enhance connection management for this use case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Secondly, DNS-SD <a href="#RFC6763">[RFC6763]</a> has evolved into a naturally session based mechanism where, for example, long-lived subscriptions lend themselves to &#8216;push&#8217; mechanisms as opposed to polling. Long-lived stateful connections and server initiated messages align with this use case <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">A general use case is that DNS traffic is often bursty but session establishment can be expensive. One challenge with long-lived connections is to maintain sufficient traffic to maintain NAT and firewall state.  To mitigate this issue this document introduces a new concept for the DNS, that is DSO &#8220;Keepalive traffic&#8221;.  This traffic carries no DNS data and is not considered &#8216;activity&#8217; in the classic DNS sense, but serves to maintain state in middle boxes, and to assure client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">There are a myriad of other potential use cases for DSO given the versatility and extensibility of this specification.</p>
<p><a href="#details">Section 4</a> of this document describes the protocol details of DNS Stateful Operations including definitions of three TLVs for session management and encryption padding. <a href="#lifecycle">Section 5</a> presents a detailed discussion of the DSO Session lifecycle including an in-depth discussion of keepalive traffic and session termination.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#details" id="details">Protocol Details</a></h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#establishment" id="establishment">DSO Session Establishment</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">DSO messages MUST only be carried in protocols and in environments where a session may be established according to the definition above.  Standard DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a><a href="#RFC7766">[RFC7766]</a>, and DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858">[RFC7858]</a> are suitable protocols.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">DNS over plain UDP <a href="#RFC0768">[RFC0768]</a> is not appropriate since it fails on the requirement for in-order message delivery, and, in the presence of NAT gateways and firewalls with short UDP timeouts, it fails to provide a persistent bi-directional communication channel unless an excessive amount of keepalive traffic is used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">In some environments it may be known in advance by external means that both client and server support DSO, and in these cases either client or server may initiate DSO messages at any time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">However, in the typical case a server will not know in advance whether a client supports DSO, so in general, unless it is known in advance by other means that a client does support DSO, a server MUST NOT initiate DSO request messages until a DSO Session has been mutually established, as described below.  Similarly, unless it is known in advance by other means that a server does support DSO, a client MUST NOT initiate non-response-requiring DSO request messages until after a DSO Session has been mutually established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">Many, but not all, DSO request messages sent by an initiator elicit a response from the responder.  Whether or not a given DSO request message elicits a response is determined by whether or not the first DSO TLV (see <a href="#tlvformat">Section 4.2.2.1</a>) in the message (the Primary TLV) is one that is specified to generate a response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">A DSO Session is established over a connection by the client sending a DSO request message of a kind that requires a response, such as the DSO Keepalive Operation TLV (see <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a>), and receiving a response, with matching MESSAGE ID, and RCODE set to NOERROR (0), indicating that the DSO request was successful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">If the RCODE is set to DSONOTIMP (tentatively 11) this indicates that the server does support DSO, but does not support the particular operation the client requested.  A server MUST NOT return DSONOTIMP for the DSO Keepalive Operation TLV. However, in future it is possible that a server may return DSONOTIMP to the first DSO message sent by the client if a client attempts to establish a DSO Session using a future response-requiring DSO TLV which the server does not understand.  If the server returns DSONOTIMP then a DSO Session is not considered established, but the client is permitted to continue sending DNS messages on the connection, including other response-requiring DSO messages such as the DSO Keepalive, which may result in a successful NOERROR response, yielding the establishment of a DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">If the RCODE is set to any value other than NOERROR (0) or DSONOTIMP (tentatively 11), then the client should assume that the server does not support DSO. In this case the client is permitted to continue sending DNS messages on that connection, but the client SHOULD NOT issue further DSO messages on that connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.9">When the server receives a response-requiring DSO request message from a client, and transmits a sucessful NOERROR response to that request, the server considers the DSO Session established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.10">When the client receives the server&#8217;s NOERROR response to its DSO request message, the client considers the DSO Session established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.11">Once a DSO Session has been established, either end may unilaterally send DSO messages at any time, and therefore either client or server may be the initiator of a message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.12">Once a DSO Session has been established, clients and servers should behave as described in this specification with regard to inactivity timeouts and connection close, not as prescribed in the previous specification for DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC7766">[RFC7766]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.1">4.1.1.</a> <a href="#middle-box-considerations" id="middle-box-considerations">Middle-box Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">Where an application-layer middle box (e.g., a DNS proxy, forwarder, or session multiplexer) is in the path the middle box MUST NOT blindly forward DSO messages in either direction, and MUST treat the inbound and outbound connections as separate sessions.  This does not preclude the use of DSO messages in the presence of an IP-layer middle box such as a NAT that rewrites IP-layer and/or transport-layer headers, but otherwise preserves the effect of a single session between the client and the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">To illustrate the above, consider a network where a middle box terminates one or more TCP connections from clients and multiplexes the queries therein over a single TCP connection to an upstream server.  The DSO messages and any associated state are specific to the individual TCP connections.  A DSO-aware middle box MAY in some circumstances be able to retain associated state and pass it between the client and server (or vice versa) but this would be highly TLV-specific.  For example, the middle box may be able to maintain a list of which clients have made Push Notification subscriptions <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a> and make its own subscription(s) on their behalf, relaying any subsequent notifications to the client (or clients) that have subscribed to that particular notification.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#format" id="format">Message Format</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">A DSO message begins with the standard twelve-octet DNS message header <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a> with the OPCODE field set to the DSO OPCODE (tentatively 6).  However, unlike standard DNS messages, the question section, answer section, authority records section and additional records sections are not present.  The corresponding count fields (QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) MUST be set to zero on transmission.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">If a DSO message is received where any of the count fields are not zero, then a FORMERR MUST be returned, unless a future document specifies otherwise.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.2.p.4">Depending on the operation, a DSO response message MAY contain no Operation TLV, because it is simply a response to a previous request message, and the MESSAGE ID in the header is sufficient to identify the request in question. Or it may contain a single corresponding response Operation TLV, with the same DSO-TYPE as in the request message. The specification for each DSO type determines whether a response for that operation type is required to carry the Operation TLV.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.2.p.5">If a DSO response is received for an operation which requires that the response carry an Operation TLV, and the required Operation TLV is not the first DSO TLV in the response message, then this is a fatal error and the recipient of the defective response message MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.1">Since the ARCOUNT field MUST be zero, a DSO message MUST NOT contain an EDNS(0) option in the additional records section.  If functionality provided by current or future EDNS(0) options is desired for DSO messages, an Operation TLV or Modifier TLV needs to be defined to carry the necessary information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.2">For example, the EDNS(0) Padding Option <a href="#RFC7830">[RFC7830]</a> used for security purposes is not permitted in a DSO message, so if message padding is desired for DSO messages then the Encryption Padding TLV described in <a href="#padding">Section 7.3</a> MUST be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.3">Similarly, a DSO message MUST NOT contain a TSIG record.  A TSIG record in a conventional DNS message is added as the last record in the additional records section, and carries a signature computed over the preceding message content. Since DSO data appears after the additional records section, it would not be included in the signature calculation.  If use of signatures with DSO messages becomes necessary in the future, an explicit Modifier TLV needs to be defined to perform this function.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.4">Note however that, while DSO <em>messages</em> cannot include EDNS(0) or TSIG records, a DSO <em>session</em> is typically used to carry a whole series of DNS messages of different kinds, including DSO messages, and other DNS message types like Query <a href="#RFC1034">[RFC1034]</a> <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a> and Update <a href="#RFC2136">[RFC2136]</a>, and those messages can carry EDNS(0) and TSIG records.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">The initiator MUST set the value of the QR bit in the DNS header to zero (0), and the responder MUST set it to one (1).  Every DSO request message (QR=0) with the Acknowledgement bit set in the operation TLV MUST elicit a response (QR=1), which MUST have the same MESSAGE ID in the DNS message header as in the corresponding request.  DSO request messages sent by the client with the Acknowledgement bit set in the operation TLV elicit a response from the server, and DSO request messages sent by the server with the Acknowledgement bit set in the operation TLV elicit a response from the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">A DSO request message (QR=0) with the Acknowledgement bit clear in the operation TLV MUST NOT elicit a response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">The namespaces of 16-bit MESSAGE IDs are disjoint in each direction.  For example, it is <em>not</em> an error for both client and server to send a request message with the same ID. In effect, the 16-bit MESSAGE ID combined with the identity of the initiator (client or server) serves as a 17-bit unique identifier for a particular operation on a DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">As described in <a href="#header">Section 4.2.1</a> An initiator MUST NOT reuse a MESSAGE ID that is already in use for an outstanding request, unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO in question. At the very least, this means that a MESSAGE ID MUST NOT be reused in a particular direction on a particular DSO Session while the initiator is waiting for a response to a previous request using that MESSAGE ID on that DSO Session, unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the DSO in question.  (For a long-lived state the MESSAGE ID for the operation MUST NOT be reused whilst that state remains active.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.5">If a client or server receives a response (QR=1) where the MESSAGE ID does not match any of its outstanding operations, this is a fatal error and it MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">With most TCP implementations, for DSO requests that generate a response, the TCP data acknowledgement (generated because data has been received by TCP), the TCP window update (generated because TCP has delivered that data to the receiving software), and the DSO response (generated by the receiving application-layer software itself) are all combined into a single packet.  Combining these three elements into a single packet gives a potentially significant improvement in network efficiency.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">For DSO requests that do not generate a response, the TCP implementation generally doesn&#8217;t have any way to know that no response will be forthcoming, so it waits fruitlessly for the application-layer software to generate a response, until the Delayed ACK timer fires <a href="#RFC1122">[RFC1122]</a> (typically 200 milliseconds) and only then does it send the TCP ack and window update.  In conjunction with Nagle&#8217;s Algorithm at the sender, this can delay the sender&#8217;s transmission of its next (non-full-sized) TCP segment, while the sender is waiting for its previous (non-full-sized) TCP segment to be acknowledged.  Nagle&#8217;s Algorithm exists to combine multiple small application writes into more efficient large TCP segments, to guard against wasteful use of the network by applications that would otherwise transmit a stream of small TCP segments, but in this case Nagle&#8217;s Algorithm (created to improve network efficiency) can interact badly with TCP&#8217;s Delayed ACK feature (also created to improve network efficiency) <a href="#NagleDA">[NagleDA]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.3">Possible mitigations for this problem include:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Disabling Nagle&#8217;s Algorithm at the sender.  This is not great, because it results in less efficient use of the network.</li>
  <li>Disabling Delayed ACK at the receiver.  This is not great, because it results in less efficient use of the network.</li>
  <li>Using a networking API that lets the receiver signal to the TCP implementation that the receiver has received and processed a client request for which it will not be generating any immediate response.  This allows the TCP implementation to operate efficiently in both cases; for requests that generate a response, the TCP ack, window update, and DSO response are transmitted together in a single TCP segment, and for requests that do not generate a response, the application-layer software informs the TCP implementation that it should go ahead and send the TCP ack and window update immediately, without waiting for the Delayed ACK timer.  Unfortunately it is not known at this time which (if any) of the widely-available networking APIs currently include this capability.</li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#sessiontimeouts" id="sessiontimeouts">DSO Session Timeouts</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">Two timeout values are associated with a DSO Session: the inactivity timeout, and the keepalive interval. Both values are carried in the same TLV, the DSO Keepalive Operation TLV (see section <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">The first timeout value, the inactivity timeout, is the maximum time for which a client may speculatively keep a DSO Session open in the expectation that it may have future requests to send to that server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">The second timeout value, the keepalive interval, is the maximum permitted interval between client messages to the server if the client wishes to keep the DSO Session alive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">The two timeout values are independent. The inactivity timeout may be lower, the same, or higher than the keepalive interval, though in most cases the inactivity timeout is expected to be shorter than the keepalive interval.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">Only when the client has a very long-lived low-traffic state does the keepalive interval come into play, to ensure that a sufficient residual amount of traffic is generated to maintain NAT and firewall state and to assure client and server that they still have connectivity to each other.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.6">On a new DSO Session, if no explicit DSO Keepalive message exchange has taken place, the default value for both timeouts is 15 seconds.  For both timeouts, lower values of the timeout result in higher network traffic and higher CPU load on the server.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3"><a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> <a href="#inactivetimer" id="inactivetimer">Inactive DSO Sessions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">At both servers and clients, the generation or reception of any complete DNS message, including DNS requests, responses, updates, or DSO messages, resets both timers for that DSO Session, with the exception that a DSO Keepalive message resets only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timeout timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">In addition, for as long as the client has an outstanding operation in progress, the inactivity timer remains cleared, and an inactivity timeout cannot occur.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">For short-lived DNS operations like traditional queries and updates, an operation is considered in progress for the time between request and response, typically a period of a few hundred milliseconds at most.  At the client, the inactivity timer is cleared upon transmission of a request and remains cleared until reception of the corresponding response.  At the server, the inactivity timer is cleared upon reception of a request and remains cleared until transmission of the corresponding response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.4">For long-lived DNS Stateful operations, an operation is considered in progress for as long as the state is active, until it is cancelled.  This means that a DSO Session can exist, with a state active, with no messages flowing in either direction, for far longer than the inactivity timeout, and this is not an error. This is why there are two separate timers: the inactivity timeout, and the keepalive interval.  Just because a DSO Session has no traffic for an extended period of time does not automatically make that DSO Session &#8220;inactive&#8221;, if it has an active state that is awaiting events.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4"><a href="#rfc.section.5.4">5.4.</a> <a href="#the-inactivity-timeout" id="the-inactivity-timeout">The Inactivity Timeout</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">The purpose of the inactivity timeout is for the server to balance its trade off between the costs of setting up new DSO Sessions and the costs of maintaining inactive DSO Sessions. A server with abundant DSO Session capacity can offer a high inactivity timeout, to permit clients to keep a speculative DSO Session open for a long time, to save the cost of establishing a new DSO Session for future communications with that server. A server with scarce memory resources can offer a low inactivity timeout, to cause clients to promptly close DSO Sessions whenever they have no outstanding operations with that server, and then create a new DSO Session later when needed.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.4.1">5.4.1.</a> <a href="#closing-inactive-dso-sessions" id="closing-inactive-dso-sessions">Closing Inactive DSO Sessions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.1">A client is NOT required to wait until the inactivity timeout expires before closing a DSO Session.  A client MAY close a DSO Session at any time, at the client&#8217;s discretion.  If a client determines that it has no current or reasonably anticipated future need for an inactive DSO Session, then the client SHOULD close that connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.2">If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session, the inactivity timeout value (i.e., 15 seconds by default) elapses without there being any operation active on the DSO Session, the client MUST gracefully close the connection with a TLS close_notify followed by a TCP FIN (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.3">If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session, twice the inactivity timeout value (i.e., 30 seconds by default), or five seconds, if twice the inactivity timeout value is less than five seconds, elapses without there being any operation active on the DSO Session, the server SHOULD consider the client delinquent, and forcibly abort the DSO Session.  For DSO Sessions over TCP (or over TLS over TCP), to avoid the burden of having a connection in TIME-WAIT state, instead of closing the connection gracefully the server SHOULD abort the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).  (In the BSD Sockets API this is achieved by setting the SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.4">In this context, an operation being active on a DSO Session includes a query waiting for a response, an update waiting for a response, or active state, but not a DSO Keepalive message exchange itself.  A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive interval timer, not the inactivity timeout timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.5">If the client wishes to keep an inactive DSO Session open for longer than the default duration without having to send traffic every 15 seconds, then it uses the DSO Keepalive message to request longer timeout values, as described in <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.1">For the inactivity timeout value, lower values result in more frequent DSO Session teardown and re-establishment.  Higher values result in larger memory burden to maintain state for inactive DSO Sessions, but lower traffic and CPU load on the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.2">A server may dictate (in a server-initiated Keepalive message, or in a response to a client-initiated Keepalive request message) any value it chooses for the inactivity timeout.  When a connection&#8217;s inactivity timeout is reached the client MUST begin closing the idle connection, but a client is NOT REQUIRED to keep an idle connection open until the inactivity timeout is reached &#8212; a client SHOULD begin closing the connection sooner if it has no reason to expect future operations with that server before the inactivity timeout is reached.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.3">A shorter inactivity timeout with a longer keepalive interval signals to the client that it should not speculatively keep an inactive DSO Session open for very long without reason, but when it does have an active reason to keep a DSO Session open, it doesn&#8217;t need to be sending an aggressive level of keepalive traffic to maintain that session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.4">A longer inactivity timeout with a shorter keepalive interval signals to the client that it may speculatively keep an inactive DSO Session open for a long time, but to maintain that inactive DSO Session it should be sending a lot of keepalive traffic.  This configuration is expected to be less common.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.5">A server may dictate any value it chooses for the inactivity timeout (either in a response to a client-initiated request, or in a server-initiated message) including values under one second, or even zero.  An inactivity timeout of zero informs the client that it should not speculatively maintain idle connections at all, and as soon as the client has completed the operation or operations relating to this server, the client should immediately begin closing this session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.6">A server will abort an idle client session after twice the inactivity timeout value, or five seconds, whichever is greater.  In the case of a zero inactivity timeout value, this means that if a client fails to close an idle client session then the server will forcibly abort the idle session after five seconds.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5.5">5.5.</a> <a href="#keepalivetimer" id="keepalivetimer">The Keepalive Interval</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">The purpose of the keepalive interval is to manage the generation of sufficient messages to maintain state in middle boxes (such at NAT gateways or firewalls) and for the client and server to periodically verify that they still have connectivity to each other. This allows them to clean up state when connectivity is lost, and attempt re-connection if appropriate.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.1">If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session, the keepalive interval value (i.e., 15 seconds by default) elapses without any DNS messages being sent or received on a DSO Session, the client MUST take action to keep the DSO Session alive, by sending a DSO Keepalive message (see <a href="#keepalive">Section 7.2</a>).  A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.2">If a client disconnects from the network abruptly, without cleanly closing its DSO Session, leaving long-lived state uncanceled, the server learns of this after failing to receive the required keepalive traffic from that client.  If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session, twice the keepalive interval value (i.e., 30 seconds by default) elapses without any DNS messages being sent or received on a DSO Session, the server SHOULD consider the client delinquent, and forcibly abort the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.1">For the keepalive interval value, lower values result in higher volume keepalive traffic. Higher values of the keepalive interval reduce traffic and CPU load, but have minimal effect on the memory burden at the server, because clients keep a DSO Session open for the same length of time (determined by the inactivity timeout) regardless of the level of keepalive traffic required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.2">It may be appropriate for clients and servers to select different keepalive interval values depending on the nature of the network they are on.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.3">A corporate DNS server that knows it is serving only clients on the internal network, with no intervening NAT gateways or firewalls, can impose a higher keepalive interval, because frequent keepalive traffic is not required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.4">A public DNS server that is serving primarily residential consumer clients, where it is likely there will be a NAT gateway on the path, may impose a lower keepalive interval, to generate more frequent keepalive traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.5">A smart client may be adaptive to its environment. A client using a private IPv4 address <a href="#RFC1918">[RFC1918]</a> to communicate with a DNS server at an address outside that IPv4 private address block, may conclude that there is likely to be a NAT gateway on the path, and accordingly request a lower keepalive interval.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.6">For environments where there is a NAT gateway or firewalls on the path, it is RECOMMENDED that clients request, and servers grant, a keepalive interval of 15 minutes. In other environments it is RECOMMENDED that clients request, and servers grant, a keepalive interval of 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.7">Note that the lower the keepalive interval value, the higher the load on client and server. For example, an keepalive interval value of 100ms would result in a continuous stream of at least ten messages per second, in both directions, to keep the DSO Session alive. And, in this extreme example, a single packet loss and retransmission over a long path could introduce a momentary pause in the stream of messages, long enough to cause the server to overzealously abort the connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.8">Because of this concern, the server MUST NOT send a Keepalive message (either a response to a client-initiated request, or a server-initiated message) with an keepalive interval value less than ten seconds.  If a client receives an Keepalive message specifying an keepalive interval value less than ten seconds this is an error and the client MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">After sending an error response to a client, the server MAY end the DSO Session, or may allow the DSO Session to remain open. For error conditions that only affect the single operation in question, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and leave the DSO Session open for further operations.  For error conditions that are likely to make all operations unsuccessful in the immediate future, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and then end the DSO Session by sending a Retry Delay request message, as described in <a href="#delay">Section 7.1</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.7"><a href="#rfc.section.5.7">5.7.</a> <a href="#error" id="error">Client Behaviour in Receiving an Error</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.7.p.1">Upon receiving an error response from the server, a client SHOULD NOT automatically close the DSO Session. An error relating to one particular operation on a DSO Session does not necessarily imply that all other operations on that DSO Session have also failed, or that future operations will fail. The client should assume that the server will make its own decision about whether or not to end the DSO Session, based on the server&#8217;s determination of whether the error condition pertains to this particular operation, or would also apply to any subsequent operations. If the server does not end the DSO Session by sending the client a Retry Delay message (see <a href="#delay">Section 7.1</a>) then the client SHOULD continue to use that DSO Session for subsequent operations.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.1">A server MUST NOT close a DSO Session with a client, except in certain exceptional circumstances, as outlined below.  In normal operation, closing a DSO Session is the client&#8217;s responsibility.  The client makes the determination of when to close a DSO Session based on an evaluation of both its own needs, and the inactivity timeout value dictated by the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.2">Some exceptional situations where a server may terminate a DSO Session include:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The server is undergoing reconfiguration or maintenance procedures that require clients to be disconnected.</li>
  <li>The server application software or underlying operating system is shutting down or restarting.</li>
  <li>The server application software terminates unexpectedly (perhaps due to a bug that makes it crash).</li>
  <li>The client fails to meets its obligation to generate keepalive traffic or close an inactive session by the prescribed times (twice the time interval dictated by the server, or five seconds, whichever is greater, as described in <a href="#sessiontimeouts">Section 5.2</a>).</li>
  <li>The client sends a grossly invalid or malformed request that is indicative of a seriously defective client implementation (see <a href="#error">Section 5.7</a>).</li>
  <li>The server is over capacity and needs to shed some load (see <a href="#retry">Section 5.9</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.4">When a server has to close a DSO Session with a client (because of exceptional circumstances such as those outlined above) the server SHOULD, whenever possible, send a Retry Delay Operation TLV (see below) informing the client of the reason for the DSO Session being closed, and allow the client five seconds to receive it before the server resorts to forcibly aborting the connection.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9">5.9.</a> <a href="#retry" id="retry">Retry Delay Operation TLV</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.1">There may be rare cases where a server is overloaded and wishes to shed load.  If a server is low on resources it MAY simply terminate a client connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).  However, the likely behavior of the client may be simply to to treat this as a network failure and connect immediately, putting more burden on the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.2">Therefore to avoid this reconnection implosion, a server SHOULD instead choose to shed client load by sending a Retry Delay request message, with an RCODE of SERVFAIL, to inform the client of the overload situation. After sending a Retry Delay request message, the server MUST NOT send any further messages on that DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.3">After sending the Retry Delay request the server SHOULD allow the client five seconds to close the connection, and if the client has not closed the connection after five seconds then the server SHOULD abort the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.4">Upon receipt of a Retry Delay request from the server, the client MUST make note of the reconnect delay for this server, and then immediately close the connection.  This is to place the burden of TCP&#8217;s TIME-WAIT state on the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.5">A Retry Delay request message MUST NOT be initiated by a client.  If a server receives a Retry Delay request message this is an error and the server MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.1">5.9.1.</a> <a href="#outstanding-operations" id="outstanding-operations">Outstanding Operations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.1.p.1">At the moment a server chooses to initiate a Retry Delay request message there may be DNS requests already in flight from client to server on this DSO Session, which will arrive at the server after its Retry Delay request message has been sent.  The server MUST silently ignore such incoming requests, and MUST NOT generate any response messages for them. When the Retry Delay request message from the server arrives at the client, the client will determine that any DNS requests it previously sent on this DSO Session, that have not yet received a response, now will certainly not be receiving any response. Such requests should be considered failed, and should be retried at a later time, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.1.p.2">In the case where some, but not all, of the existing operations on a DSO Session have become invalid (perhaps because the server has been reconfigured and is no longer authoritative for some of the names), but the server is terminating all DSO Sessions en masse with a REFUSED (5) RCODE, the RECONNECT DELAY MAY be zero, indicating that the clients SHOULD immediately attempt to re-establish operations.  It is likely that some of the attempts will be successful and some will not.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.1.p.3">In the case where a server is terminating a large number of DSO Sessions at once (e.g., if the system is restarting) and the server doesn&#8217;t want to be inundated with a flood of simultaneous retries, it SHOULD send different RECONNECT delay values to each client.  These adjustments MAY be selected randomly, pseudorandomly, or deterministically (e.g., incrementing the time value by one tenth of a second for each successive client, yielding a post-restart reconnection rate of ten clients per second).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.1">After a DSO Session is closed by the server, the client SHOULD try to reconnect, to that server, or to another suitable server, if more than one is available.  If reconnecting to the same server, the client MUST respect the indicated delay before attempting to reconnect.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.2">If a particular server does not want a client to reconnect (it is being de-commissioned), it SHOULD set the retry delay to the maximum value (which is approximately 497 days). If the server will only be out of service for a maintenance period, it should use a value closer to the expected maintenance window and not default to a very large delay value or clients may not attempt to reconnect after it resumes service.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6"><a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#sharing" id="sharing">Connection Sharing</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">As previously specified for DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC7766">[RFC7766]</a>, to mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS clients MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent TCP connections made to any individual server.  It is RECOMMENDED that for any given client/server interaction there SHOULD be no more than one connection for regular queries, one for zone transfers, and one for each protocol that is being used on top of TCP (for example, if the resolver was using TLS).  However, it is noted that certain primary/secondary configurations with many busy zones might need to use more than one TCP connection for zone transfers for operational reasons (for example, to support concurrent transfers of multiple zones).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">A single server may support multiple services, including DNS Updates <a href="#RFC2136">[RFC2136]</a>, DNS Push Notifications <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a>, and other services, for one or more DNS zones.  When a client discovers that the target server for several different operations is the same target hostname and port, the client SHOULD use a single shared DSO Session for all those operations.  A client SHOULD NOT open multiple connections to the same target host and port just because the names being operated on are different or happen to fall within different zones.  This is to reduce unnecessary connection load on the DNS server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">However, server implementers and operators should be aware that connection sharing may not be possible in all cases.  A single client device may be home to multiple independent client software instances that don&#8217;t coordinate with each other.  Similarly, multiple independent client devices behind the same NAT gateway will also typically appear to the DNS server as different source ports on the same client IP address.  Because of these constraints, a DNS server MUST be prepared to accept multiple connections from different source ports on the same client IP address.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">The Keepalive Operation TLV (DSO-TYPE=1) performs two functions: to reset the keepalive timer for the DSO Session and to establish the values for the Session Timeouts.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">The Keepalive Operation TLV resets only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer.  The reason for this is that periodic Keepalive Operation TLVs are sent for the sole purpose of keeping a DSO Session alive, because that DSO Session has current or recent non-maintenance activity that warrants keeping the DSO Session alive.  If sending keepalive traffic itself were to reset the inactivity timer, then that would create a circular livelock where keepalive traffic would be sent indefinitely to keep a DSO Session alive, where the only activity on that DSO Session would be the keepalive traffic keeping the DSO Session alive so that further keepalive traffic can be sent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">Sending keepalive traffic is considered a maintenance activity that is performed in service of other client activities.  Sending keepalive traffic itself is not considered a client activity.  For a DSO Session to be considered active, it must be carrying something more than just keepalive traffic.  This is why merely sending a Keepalive Operation TLV does not reset the inactivity timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.4">When sent by a client, the Keepalive Operation TLV MUST have the Acknowledgement bit set.  It resets a DSO Session&#8217;s keepalive timer, and at the same time requests what the Session Timeout values should be from this point forward in the DSO Session.  If a server receives a Keepalive Operation TLV without the Acknowledgement bit set then this is a fatal error and the server MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.5">Once a DSO Session is in progress (see <a href="#details">Section 4</a>) the Keepalive TLV also MAY be initiated by a server.  When sent by a server, the Keepalive Operation TLV MUST NOT have the Acknowledgement bit set.  It resets a DSO Session&#8217;s keepalive timer, and unilaterally informs the client of the new Session Timeout values to use from this point forward in this DSO Session.  No client response to this unilateral declaration is required.  If a client receives a Keepalive Operation TLV with the Acknowledgement bit set then this is a fatal error and the client MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.6">It is not required that the Keepalive TLV be used in every DSO Session.  While many DNS Stateful operations will be used in conjunction with a long-lived session state, not all DNS Stateful operations require long-lived session state, and in some cases the default 15-second value for both the inactivity timeout and keepalive interval may be perfectly appropriate.  However, note that for clients that implement only the TLVs defined in this document it is the only way for a client to initiate a DSO Session.</p>

If the client does not generate the mandated keepalive traffic, then after twice this interval the server will forcibly terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).  Since the minimum allowed keepalive interval is ten seconds, the minimum time at which a server will forcibly disconnect a client for failing to generate the mandated keepalive traffic is twenty seconds.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.9">In a client-initiated DSO Keepalive message, the Session Timeouts contain the client&#8217;s requested values.  In a server response to a client-initiated message, the Session Timeouts contain the server&#8217;s chosen values, which the client MUST respect.  This is modeled after the DHCP protocol, where the client requests a certain lease lifetime using DHCP option 51 <a href="#RFC2132">[RFC2132]</a>, but the server is the ultimate authority for deciding what lease lifetime is actually granted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.10">In a server-initiated DSO Keepalive message, the Session Timeouts unilaterally inform the client of the new values from this point forward in this DSO Session. The client MUST NOT generate a response to the server-initiated DSO Keepalive message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.11">When a client is sending its second and subsequent Keepalive DSO requests to the server, the client SHOULD continue to request its preferred values each time.

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.1">When a client receives a response to its client-initiated DSO Keepalive message, or receives a server-initiated DSO Keepalive message, the client has then received Session Timeout values dictated by the server. The two timeout values contained in the DSO Keepalive TLV from the server may each be higher, lower, or the same as the respective Session Timeout values the client previously had for this DSO Session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.2">In the case of the keepalive timer, the handling of the received value is straightforward. The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV itself resets the keepalive timer and updates the keepalive interval for the DSO Session. The new keepalive interval indicates the maximum time that may elapse before another message must be sent or received on this DSO Session, if the DSO Session is to remain alive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.1.p.3">In the case of the inactivity timeout, the handling of the received value is a little more subtle, though the meaning of the inactivity timeout is unchanged &#8212; it still indicates the maximum permissible time allowed without activity on a DSO Session.  The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV does not itself reset the inactivity timer. The time elapsed since the last useful activity on this DSO Session is unaffected by exchange of DSO Keepalive messages.  The new inactivity timeout value in the DSO Keepalive TLV in the received message does update the timeout associated with the running inactivity timer; that becomes the new maximum permissible time without activity on a DSO Session.</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>If the current inactivity timer value is not greater than the new inactivity timeout, then the DSO Session may remain open for now.  When the inactivity timer value exceeds the new inactivity timeout, the client MUST then begin closing the DSO Session, as described above.</li>
  <li>If the current inactivity timer value is already greater than the new inactivity timeout, then this DSO Session has already been inactive for longer than the server permits, and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.</li>
  <li>If the current inactivity timer value is already more than twice the new inactivity timeout, then the client is immediately considered delinquent (this DSO Session is immediately eligible to be forcibly terminated by the server) and the client MUST immediately begin closing this DSO Session.  However if a server abruptly reduces the inactivity timeout in this way, then, to give the client time to close the connection gracefully before the server resorts to terminating it forcibly, the server SHOULD give the client an additional grace period of one quarter of the new inactivity timeout, or five seconds, whichever is greater.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">Future extensions to this specification (and non-standard implementations) could, in principle, define TLVs that include client identifiers and personal data in a similar manner to some non-standard deployed uses of EDNS0 <a href="#I-D.tale-dnsop-edns0-clientid">[I-D.tale-dnsop-edns0-clientid]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">Such uses of the protocol are highly likely to compromise the privacy of DNS users and increase the tracking capabilities of pervasive monitoring in conflict with <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a> (Pervasive monitoring is an Attack).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">Any such extensions proposed to the IETF would require careful considerations with regard to the principles laid out in <a href="#RFC6973">[RFC6973]</a> (Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols) and <a href="#RFC8165">[RFC8165]</a> (Design Considerations for Metadata Insertion) and should require at a minimum that those options are only used on encrypted transports (or the data is directly encrypted)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.5">Any such non-standard uses of this protocol are regarded as a direct violation of <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a>.</p>
